The volume broke the taboo against raising the subject in public and laid the groundwork for the literature on the disabled that followed." --Library Journal</p>Pearl S. Buck (1892&#x2013;1973) was a bestselling and Nobel Prize&#x2013;winning author. Her classic novel <i>The Good Earth</i> (1931) was awarded a Pulitzer Prize and William Dean Howells Medal. Born in Hillsboro, West Virginia, Buck was the daughter of missionaries and spent much of the first half of her life in China, where many of her books are set. In 1934, civil unrest in China forced Buck back to the United States. Throughout her life she worked in support of civil and women&#x2019;s rights, and established Welcome House, the first international, interracial adoption agency. In addition to her highly acclaimed novels, Buck wrote two memoirs and biographies of both of her parents. For her body of work, Buck&nbsp;received&nbsp;the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1938, the first American woman to have done so. She died in Vermont.&nbsp;</p><h2>Selections for Contracts: Uniform Commercial Code, Restatement (Selected Statutes)</h2><p>Suitable for use in combination with any law school contract text or casebook, the 2011 Edition of Selections for Contracts: Statutes, Restatement Second, Forms compiles the major statutes, forms, and other materials affecting contract law.

However, the French soon began to resent the Americans for their brashness and display of wealth, while the Americans found the French and their habits equally irritating and incomprehensible: they bathed too little, drank too much, and were almost unfailingly unfriendly.<br> To bridge the cultural divide, the War Department commissioned humorist Leo Rosten to write this surprisingly candid guide that paired common complaints about the French with answers aimed at promoting understanding. From the fascinations of French nightlife to Gallic grooming and fashions, the guide sought to correct the misconceptions behind a litany of common complaints: <i>Laissez-faire</i> is not in fact a call to laziness, and the French do not play checkers in caf�s all day&#x2014;though they do extol the virtues of a leisurely lunch. The moral principles of the Frenchwoman ought not to be drawn from the few one might find loitering on the fringes of the camp.<br> Beyond their intended instructive purposes, the grievances included in the guide are at times as revealing of the preconceptions of the American servicemen as they are of the French, as well as offering fascinating insight into the details of daily life immediately after the war, including the acute poverty, the shortage of food and supplies, and the scale of destruction suffered by France during the six years of conflict. Illustrated throughout with charming cartoons and written in a direct, no-nonsense style, <i>112 Gripes about the French </i>is by turns amusing and thought-provoking in its valiant stand against prejudice and stereotype.<br></p><p>&#39;A reminder of just how difficult it is to dislodge cultural prejudices and stereotypes&#39; * The Boston Globe *</p><h2>Bald Is Better with Earrings: A Survivor&#39;s Guide to Getting Through Breast Cancer</h2><p><p>The breast cancer guide every woman needs for herself, her best friend, and her sister&#x2014;a warm, practical, relatable handbook, that dispels the terror, taking you step-by-step through the process, from diagnosis to post-treatment.</p><p>When Andrea Hutton was diagnosed with breast cancer, she wanted to know everything.

Born Janet Miriam Holland Taylor Caldwell in Manchester, England, she moved with her family to Buffalo, New York, in 1907. She started writing stories when she was eight years old and completed her first novel when she was twelve. Married at age eighteen, Caldwell worked as a stenographer and court reporter to help support her family and took college courses at night, earning a bachelor of arts degree from the University of Buffalo in 1931. She adopted the pen name Taylor Caldwell because legendary editor Maxwell Perkins thought her debut novel, <i>Dynasty of Death </i>(1938), would be better received if readers assumed it were written by a man. In a career that spanned five decades, Caldwell published forty novels, many of which were <i>New York Times </i>bestsellers. Her best-known works include the historical sagas <i>The Sound of Thunder </i>(1957), <i>Testimony of Two Men </i>(1968), <i>Captains and the Kings </i>(1972), and <i>Ceremony of the Innocent </i>(1976), and the spiritually themed novels <i>The Listener </i>(1960) and <i>No One Hears But Him </i>(1966). <i>Dear and Glorious Physician </i>(1958), a portrayal of the life of St. Luke, and <i>Great Lion of God</i> (1970), about the life of St. Paul, are among the bestselling religious novels of all time. Caldwell&#x2019;s last novel, <i>Answer as a Man</i> (1981), hit the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller list before its official publication date. She died at her home in Greenwich, Connecticut, in 1985.<br><br> To read more about the life and work of Taylor Caldwell, please visit www.taylorcaldwell.com.&#x201c;An absorbing story .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

Scott Fitzgerald, and later writers were forever indebted. Defying the prudish sensibilities of his time, Anderson never omitted anything adult, harsh, or shocking; instead he embraced frankness, truth, and the hidden depths everyone possesses. Here we meet young George Willard, a newspaper reporter with dreams; Kate Swift, the schoolteacher who attempts to seduce him; Wing Biddlebaum, a berry picker whose hands are the source of both his renown and shame; Alice Hindman, who has one last adventure; and all the other complex human beings whose portraits brought American literature into the modern age. Their stories make up a classic and place its author alongside the best of American writers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>With an Introduction by Irving Howe<br>and an Afterword by Dean Koontz<br>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Library Journal</i> praised this edition of Sherwood Anderson's famed short stories as "the finest edition of this seminal work available." Reconstructed to be as close to the original text as possible, <i>Winesburg, Ohio</i> depicts the strange, secret lives of the inhabitants of a small town. In "Hands," Wing Biddlebaum tries to hide the tale of his banishment from a Pennsylvania town, a tale represented by his hands. In "Adventure," lonely Alice Hindman impulsively walks naked into the night rain. Threaded through the stories is the viewpoint of George Willard, the young newspaper reporter who, like his creator, stands witness to the dark and despairing dealings of a community of isolated people.In 1919 a middle-aged Chicago advertising writer from Ohio, a failure as a businessman, husband, and father, published a slim yellow book of short stories intended to &#34;reform&#34; American literature. Sherwood Anderson strove to portray the buried inner lives of &#34;pathetic grotesques&#34; - people wounded by life in body or spirit - and to tell their stories in short revelations rather than in sweeping novels. Against all expectations, Winesburg Ohio: A Group of Tales of Ohio Small Town Life accomplished what its author intended. Afterwards, American literature would be written and read differently. Writers of short fiction learned from Anderson to achieve both character-centered form and daring Modernist subject matter. Sherwood Anderson&#39;s Winesburg, Ohio, authorized by the Sherwood Anderson Literary Estate Trust, is an expert text, in that Ray Lewis White has consulted all Anderson manuscripts, typescripts, letters, diaries, and all editions of the book to present the masterpiece as it was intended. White&#39;s edition also is informed by his 35 years of experience in editing, studying, and appreciating Sherwood Anderson and his fiction. New to this edition of Winesburg, Ohio are historical and cultural annotations, documentation of changes of various editions, identification of the Ohio originals of Anderson&#39;s characters; and maps of the real town of Clyde, in North Central Ohio, which was the basis of Anderson&#39;s fictional account. Included as well are unique photographs of Anderson and Clyde that deepen knowledge and feeling for the author&#39;s time and his work.</p><h2>Fiber Optic Communications</h2><p><p> <b> </b> This new and fully revised Fifth Edition of Fiber Optic Communications incorporates coverage of significant advances made in the fiber industry in recent years to present a comprehensive and in-depth introduction to the basics of communicating with optical fiber transmission lines.

Palais marks the book's twentieth anniversary. In the 20 years since the first edition of the book was published, fiber optics systems have become more flexible and less costly and information capacity and transmission length have increased. This edition includes the many new and improved components and system architectures that have been added to the fiber-optic-communications designer's tool kit. </p> <b>New component discussions describe</b> <ul> <li>Improved fibers that more fully utilize the optical spectrum</li> <li>Non-zero dispersion shifted fibers</li> <li>Graded-index polymer fibers</li> <li>Raman amplifiers</li> <li>Erbium-doped waveguide amplifiers</li> <li>Arrayed waveguide gratings</li> <li>Electroabsorption modulators</li> <li>Optical micro-electro-mechanical (MEMs) components</li> <li>Dispersion compensators</li> <li>Tunable light sources</li> <li>Tunable filters</li> <li>Small-form-factor connectors</li> <li>Non-adhesive splices</li> </ul> <b>Expanded coverage of system strategies and considerations include</b> <ul> <li>Optical time-division multiplexing</li> <li>Dense and coarse wavelength-division multiplexing</li> <li>Polarization mode dispersion</li> <li>External modulation</li> </ul> <p> The fifth edition also includes new problems, new figures, new worked examples, and an updated bibliography. </p><p> Fiber optic communications developed very quickly after the first low-loss fibers were produced in 1970. Operational fiber systems are now common, and new installations and applications appear continually. Communication by fibers has taken over many of the functions previously performed by copper-based systems and extended them significantly. Fibers have become an enabling technology in the information society in which we live. They work together with the remaining copper applications and the growing wireless infrastructure to meet our expanding communications needs. </p> <p> Fiber technology has matured sufficiently so that many books have been written on the subject. Some of these books are quite detailed in terms of theoretical and mathematical content, and the beginner could find the level difficult. </p> <p> This text is intended to be less difficult, while still bringing to the reader the information necessary to understand the design, operation, and capabilities of fiber systems. Important theoretical and mathematical results are given without accompanying lengthy proofs. However, results are explained in physical terms when possible and appropriate, and extensive tables and figures are used to make those results readily usable. To provide a realistic view, numerical values are given for the ranges of typical device parameters. </p> <p> When the first edition of this book appeared in 1984, fibers had already crisscrossed much of the United States and many other countries to deliver telephone messages between the major exchanges. By 1988, when the second edition was published, the land-based long-distance fiber telephone network was nearly complete, and submarine fiber telephone cables were being installed beneath the major oceans. In addition, fiber optic local-area networks (LANs) were in development. When the third edition went to press in 1992, over 10 million kilometers of fiber had been installed worldwide, undersea cables were being constructed, and installation of fiber LANs was increasing. By 1998, when the fourth edition was published, numerous submarine fiber cables covering the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and many smaller seas were operational. In addition, numerous tests had been completed for bringing fiber to all homes, holding out the promise for expanded services to the individual subscriber. With this fifth edition, we note several new developments. The demand for more transmission bandwidth (particularly for Internet and business applications) has required design of fiber systems carrying information at terabit-per-second rates over great distances. Metropolitan area networks (MANS) have become significant parts of the fiber industry. Bringing fiber connections to the home is still a goal, but an elusive one. Economic considerations have slowed progress in this direction. </p> <p> It is the insatiable demand for greater bandwidth that makes this fifth edition necessary. The fundamentals have not changed, but new technological advances and improvements have emerged to satisfy this demand. I have attempted to work these new ideas into the previous edition with as little disruption as possible. </p> <p> This is an introductory book. No background in fiber optics or in optic communications is assumed. Only the simplest concepts from algebra and trigonometry are invoked in explaining the characteristics of fiber systems. Appropriate background material on optics, electronics, and communications is introduced in the text as needed. </p> <p> This book was originally based on a set of notes I developed and used for numerous short courses on fiber optic communications. Participants in these courses had training ranging from two years of technical school through the Ph.D. level. Jobs varied from designer to board chairman. Attendees included personnel from industry, government, and academia. Individual backgrounds were in chemistry, physics, and many areas of engineering. In addition to the short course presentatior3.s, I have taught this material to over 1,500 electrical engineering students at the senior and first-yeargraduate level. The course has been taught over television for more than 20 years. In the last few years it has also been available as an Internet-delivered class. </p> <p> The professionals benefiting from this book include practicing design engineers concerned with the selection and application of components and with the design and evaluation of systems. Knowledge of the entire system is useful for the device designer as well. Others involved in fiber optics, such as high-level engineering-decision makers, project managers, technicians, marketing and sales personnel, and teachers, can also obtain valuable information from the material presented. </p> <p> The organization of the book is as follows. Block diagrams of entire fiber optic systems are presented at the outset. This identifies the components of fiber systems, providing motivation for their individual study in succeeding chapters. Chapters 2 and 3 contain a review of important results from the fields of optics and wave travel. This basic information is needed for an understanding of fiber optic devices and systems. Chapter 4, on integrated optics, introduces the technology of combining optic components onto a single substrate. The integrated optic waveguide provides an excellent, simplified model for propagation of light in a fiber. Chapters 5-9 present the main devices encountered in a fiber optic system. These are the fiber, the light source, the light detector, the couplers, and the distribution networks. System considerations appear in Chapters 10-12, where modulation formats, the effects of noise on message quality, and system design are covered. The last chapter includes examples of operational systems. In that chapter, the design information developed throughout the book is applied to realistic problems. </p> <p> I expect the reader who has mastered this material to be able to design and specify systems and to choose and evaluate such system components as fibers, light sources, detectors, and couplers. Commercially available subsystems, such as complete transmitters and receivers, will also be amenable to evaluation by the techniques presented in this book. </p> <p> This new and fully revised edition of <i>Fiber Optic Communications</i> incorporates significant advances made in the fiber industry since publication of the fourth edition. Because the fundamentals of the technology have remained the same, the number of changes is moderate. Nonetheless, the changes and additions are significant. Added or expanded topics include the following: Raman amplifiers, erbium-doped waveguide amplifiers, arrayed waveguide gratings, electroabsorption modulators, optical microelectro-mechanical (MEMs) components, dispersion compensation, tunable light sources, tunable filters, optical time-division multiplexing, dense and coarse wavelength-division multiplexing, increased utilization of the optical spectrum, and emphasis on external modulation. A new table showing the current spectral band classification scheme has been added. Small-form-factor connectors and nonadhesive splices are described. In addition, the discussions in a number of sections were modified to improve the clarity of the presentation. </p> <p> Because numerous colleges adopted the initial text for an undergraduate course in fiber optics, a homework problem set was inserted in the second edition. New problems have been added, and several of the old ones have been updated for this new edition, making this text's use in the classroom even more desirable. Some problems are merely "plug-in"-type questions, intended to give the student practice and confidence in understanding of the material presented. Other problems take more thought and might even require finding and reviewing material from other sources. Answers to most problems appear at the end of the book, and a new solutions manual is available for instructors. </p> <p> Many new references have been added. The bibliography and periodicals listing at the end of the text provides a resource for further study. The bibliography includes both older "classic" fiber optics presentations and several newer ones that have appeared since the last edition of this textbook. </p> <p> I find that the first seven chapters can be covered in a one-semester course. This introduces all the major system components to the students, allowing those who have mastered the material to enter productively into the fiber industry. The last five chapters, on more advanced topics, can be covered in a second term. To simplify the mathematics and reach a wider audience, many of the results presented in the text are not fully derived. Instructors of well-prepared students, such as seniors in electrical engineering programs, may wish to fill in the derivations to deepen student understanding. </p> <p><b>FIBER OPTIC SOFTWARE</b></p> <p> All technical workers and students have access to personal computers and the Internet. Because of this, many groups have developed software to illustrate fiber-related phenomena and to aid analysis and design. Several such programs are available through my home page (www.fulton.asu.edu/~palais). Some of these are available on CDs for instructors adopting the textbook. In addition, PowerPoint slides covering much of the textbook material are available on CDs to assist lecturers. </p> <p><b>ONLINE COURSE AVAILABILITY</b></p> <p> A two-semester course covering the material in the textbook is available online (and on CDs or DVDs) for university credit, for continuing education credit, or for self study. The online version contains lectures by the author, demonstrations, homework, and exams. Contact the author for information (joseph.palais@asu.edu). </p> <p> JOSEPH C.

On the 50th anniversary of its publication in November 1949, for which Algren was honored with the first National Book Award (which he received from none other than Eleanor Roosevelt at a ceremony in March 1950), Seven Stories is proud to release the first critical edition of an Algren work.<br>A novel of rare genius, The Man with the Golden Arm describes the dissolution of a card-dealing WWII veteran named Frankie Machine, caught in the act of slowly cutting his own heart into wafer-thin slices. For Frankie, a murder committed may be the least of his problems.<br>The literary critic Malcolm Cowley called The Man with the Golden Arm "Algren's defense of the individual," while Carl Sandburg wrote of its "strange midnight dignity." A literary tour de force, here is a novel unlike any other, one in which drug addiction, poverty, and human failure somehow suggest a defense of human dignity and a reason for hope.<br>Special contributions by Russell Banks, Bettina Drew, James R. Giles, Carlo Rotella, William Savage, Lee Stringer, Studs Terkel, Kurt Vonnegut, and others.</p><p>11 1.5-hour cassettes<p>One of the most neglected of modern American authors and also one of the best loved, <b>NELSON ALGREN</b> (1909&#x2013;1981) believed that &#x201c;literature is made upon any occasion that a challenge is put to the legal apparatus by conscience in touch with humanity.&#x201d; His own voluminous body of work stands up to that belief. Algren&#x2019;s powerful voice rose from the urban wilderness of postwar Chicago, and it is to that city of hustlers, addicts and scamps that he returned again and again, eventually raising Chicago&#x2019;s &#x201c;lower depths&#x201d; up onto a stage for the whole world to behold. Recipient of the first National Book Award for fiction and lauded by Hemingway as &#x201c;one of the two best authors in America,&#x201d; Algren remains among our most defiant and enduring novelists. His work includes five major novels, two short fiction collections, a book-length poem and several collections of reportage. A source of inspiration to artists as diverse as Kurt Vonnegut and Donald Barthelme, Studs Terkel and Lou Reed, Algren died on May 9, 1981, within days of his appointment as a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.</p></p><h2>The Interpreter&#39;s Bible, Vol. 11: Philippians, Colossians, Thessalonians, Pastoral Epistles, Philemon, Hebrews</h2><p>Complete, understandable commentary includes: double text with RSV and KJV in parallel columns; exegesis, clarification of text meaning; exposition, application of text to today&#39;s needs; introductions with summaries of each book; general articles, indexes, maps, more!

Obsessed with strategies of seduction, speculating endlessly about the motives and goals of lovers, the idle aristocrats who populate these novels are exclusively preoccupied with their erotic life. Deprived of other battlefields to fulfill their thirst for glory, libertine noblemen seek to conquer the women of their class without falling into the trap of love, while their female prey attempt to enjoy the pleasures of love without sacrificing their honor. Yet, despite the licentious mores of the declining Old Regime, men and women are still expected to pay lip service to an austere code of morals. Since they are constantly asked to denounce their own practices, their erotic war games are governed by a double constraint: whatever they feel or intend, the heroes of libertine literature can neither say what they mean nor mean what they say.<i> The Libertine Reader </i>includes all the varieties of libertine strategies: from the successful cunning of Mme de T_____ in Vivant Denon's No Tomorrow to the ill-fated genius of Mme de Merteuil in Laclos's Dangerous Liaisons; from the laborious sentimental education of Meilcour in Crebillon fils's The Wayward Head and Heart to the hazardous master plan of the French ambassador in Prevost's The Story of a Modern Greek Woman. The discrepancies between the characters' words and their true intentions&#x2015;the libertine double entendre&#x2015;are exposed through the speaking vaginas in Diderot's The Indiscreet Jewels and the wandering soul of Amanzei in Crebillon fils's The Sofa, while the contrasts between natural and civilized&#x2015;or degenerate&#x2015;erotics are the subjects of both Diderot's Supplement to Bougainville's Voyage and Laclos's On the Education of Women. Finally, Sade's Florville and Courval shows that destiny itself is on the side of libertinism.</p></p><p>Michel Feher, a Belgian philosopher, is the author of <i>Powerless by Design: The Age of the International Community </i>and the editor of <i>Nongovernmental Politics</i> and <i>Europe at a Crossroads,&nbsp;</i>among other titles.

For the Greek myths, Bulfinch drew on Ovid and Virgil, and for the sagas of the north, from Mallet's Northern Antiquities. He provides lively versions of the myths of Zeus and Hera, Venus and Adonis, Daphne and Apollo, and their cohorts on Mount Olympus; the love story of Pygmalion and Galatea; the legends of the Trojan War and the epic wanderings of Ulysses and Aeneas; the joys of Valhalla and the furies of Thor; and the tales of Beowulf and Robin Hood. <br><br>The tales are eminently readable.

His powerful debut, <em>The Souls of Yellow Folk</em>, does more than collect a decade&#x2019;s worth of cult-reputation essays&#x2015;it corrals new American herds of pickup artists, school shooters, mandarin zombies, and immigrant strivers, and exposes them to scrutiny, empathy, and polemical force.</p><p>In his celebrated and prescient essay &#x201c;The Face of Seung-Hui Cho,&#x201d; Yang explores the deranged logic of the Virginia Tech shooter. In his National Magazine Award&#x2013;winning &#x201c;Paper Tigers,&#x201d; he explores the intersection of Asian values and the American dream, and the inner torment of the child exposed to &#x201c;tiger mother&#x201d; parenting. And in his close reading of <em>New York Magazine</em>&#x2019;s popular Sex Diaries, he was among the first critics to take seriously today&#x2019;s Internet-mediated dating lives.</p><p>Yang catches these ugly trends early because he has felt at various times implicated in them, and he does not exempt himself from his radical honesty. His essays retain the thrill of discovery, the wary eye of the first explorer, and the rueful admission of the first exposed.</p></p><p><strong>Wesley Yang</strong> has written for the <em>New York Times Magazine</em>, <em>Harper&#x2019;s</em>, the <em>New York Times Book Review</em>, <em>New York Magazine</em>, <em>Esquire</em>, <em>Tablet</em>, and <em>n+1</em>.

With lucidity and unsentimental humanity, Wesley Yang shows us a new type of forgotten man, one whose suffering is primarily psychological. We often think of the brutality of private life as the natural province of fiction or memoir, but Yang combines the novel&#x2019;s power to dissect personal psychology with the breadth, directness and raw honesty of the essay.

Henslin,</b> who was born in Minnesota, graduated from high school and junior college in California and from college in Indiana. Awarded scholarships, he earned his Master�s and doctorate degrees in sociology at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. After this, he was awarded a postdoctoral fellowship from the National Institute of Mental Health, and spent a year studying how people adjust to the suicide of a family member. His primary interests in sociology are the sociology of everyday life, deviance, and international relations. Among his more than a dozen books is <i>Down to Earth Sociology</i> (Free Press), now in its eleventh edition, a book of readings that reflects some of these sociological interests. He has also published widely in sociology journals, including <i>Social Problems</i> and <i>American Journal of Sociology.</i> While a graduate student, James Henslin taught at the University of Missouri at St. Louis. After completing his doctorate, he joined the faculty at Southern Illinois University, Edwardsville, where he is Professor Emeritus of Sociology. He says, "I've always found the introductory course enjoyable to teach. I love to see students' faces light up when they first glimpse the sociological perspective and begin to see how society has become an essential part of how they view the world." Henslin enjoys spending time with his wife, reading, and fishing. His two favorite activities are writing and traveling. He especially enjoys living in other cultures, for this brings him face to face with behaviors and ways of thinking that he cannot take for granted, experiences that "make sociological principles come alive."</p><h2>Toward a Simpler Way of Life: The Arts and Crafts Architects of California</h2><p>This book celebrates one of the richest and most enduring themes in American architecture&#x2014;California's Arts and Crafts Movement. Echoing the writings of Helen Hunt Jackson, Charles F. Lummis, and Charles Keeler, this movement represented a retreat into a quieter place from the materialism of American society. Anti-commercial, anti-modern, Arts and Crafts practitioners drew on the decorative schemes of English Tudor, Swiss chalet, Japanese temple, and Spanish mission, evoking an earlier time before modern industry and technology intruded. And if only one word is used to describe virtually every Arts and Crafts house in California, that word is "woodsy": wood shingles outside, wood paneling inside, a wood fire burning in the homey, welcoming fireplace.<br><br>Most chapters in this impressive and very readable book focus on one building by a particular architect or designer and illustrate that person's development and influences. Familiar architects such as Bernard Maybeck, Charles and Henry Greene, John Galen Howard, and Julia Morgan are here, but so too are less well-known names who were a vibrant part of the Arts and Crafts Movement. These late Romantics designed houses to complement nature rather than contrast with it. Their eclecticism and historicism reflected a Romantic bent as well, no doubt cultivated by their familiarity with the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where, in fact, Howard, Maybeck, and Morgan studied.<br><br>The book's contributors also give attention to the builders, contractors, and craftsmen whose skills contributed to the lasting impact of the California Arts and Crafts Movement. Superb illustrations provide examples of elevations, composition details, interior fixtures, and gardens, all designed to promote the "simple living and high thinking" of the Craftsman style, an esthetic that continues to influence architecture today.</p><p><b>Robert Winter</b> is Arthur G. Coons Professor of the History of Ideas, Emeritus, at Occidental College in Los Angeles. He is the author of <i>The California Bungalow</i> (1980), <i>American Bungalow Style</i> (1996), and coauthor of <i>A Guide to Architecture in San Francisco and Northern California</i> (1985) and <i>Los Angeles: An Architectural Guide</i> (1994).These two excellent books are joined spiritually as they explore the Arts &amp; Crafts movement's quest for a retreat from the materialism of the Gilded Age as manifested on different sides of the continent. Inspiring Reform is an exhibition catalog from the Davis Museum and Cultural Center's centenary celebration of Boston's Society of Arts &amp; Crafts, which sponsored the earliest exhibition of Arts &amp; Crafts pieces in America in 1897. The Davis exhibit, which will also be at the Smithsonian, covers the years 1890-1930 and features 150 examples of furniture, ceramics, metalware, book art, prints, and very unique photography. More than 230 illustrations?40 in color?acccompany the catalog's ten essays, all written by specialists in the field. Another essay collection, Toward a Simpler Way of Life, focuses on the variety of styles of Arts &amp; Crafts structures found in California. In their drive toward the anticommercial, the practitioners drew on the decorative schemes of English Tudor, Swiss Chalet, Japanese Temple, and Spanish Mission styles to evoke an earlier, preindustrial time. As expected, Bernard Maybeck, the Greene Brothers, and Julia Morgan are here, but so are many talented, lesser-known designers. The knowledgeable essays also give due attention to the builders, contractors, and artisans who contributed so much. The book will have a bounty of 365 period duotone photos, not seen by the reviewer.

The church fathers mined the Old Testament throughout for prophetic utterances regarding the Messiah, but few books yielded as much messianic ore as the Twelve Prophets, sometimes known as the Minor Prophets, not because of their relative importance but because of the relative brevity of their writings. Encouraged by the example of the New Testament writers themselves, the church fathers found numerous parallels between the Gospels and the prophetic books. Among the events foretold, they found not only the flight into Egypt after the nativity, the passion and resurrection of Christ, and the outpuoring of the Spirit at Pentecost, but also Judas&#39;s act of betrayal, the earthquake at Jesus&#39; death and the rending of the temple veil. Detail upon detail brimmed with significance for Christian doctrine, including baptism and the Eucharist as well as the relation between the covenants. In this rich and vital resource edited by Alberto Ferreiro you will find excerpts, some translated here into English for the first time, from more than thirty church fathers, ranging in time from Clement of Rome, Justin Martyr and Irenaeus (late first and early second centuries) to Gregory the Great, Braulio of Saragossa and Bede the Venerable (late sixth to early eighth centuries). Geographically the sources range from the great Cappadocians--Basil the Great, Gregory of Nazianzus, Gregory of Nyssa--John Chrysostom, Ephrem the Syrian and Hippolytus in the East to Ambrose, Augustine, Cyprian and Tertullian in the West and Origen, Cyril and Pachomius in Egypt.

Here the insights of scores of early church fathers will be assembled and made readily available for significant passages throughout the Bible and the Apocrypha. It is hard to think of a more worthy ecumenical project to be undertaken by InterVarsity Press." (Bruce M. Metzger, professor emeritus of New Testament, Princeton Theological Seminary)<br><br>"For those who think that church history began around 1941, when their pastor was born, this commentary will be a great surprise. Christians throughout the centuries have read the biblical text and nursed their spirits with it and then applied it to their lives. These commentaries reflect that the witness of the Holy Spirit was present in his church throughout the centuries. As a result, we can profit by allowing the ancient Christians to speak to us today." (Haddon Robinson, Harold John Ockenga Distinguished Professor of Preaching, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary)<br><br>"There is no shortage of new books on the market and it may be a surprise to some to see IVP producing the Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture series. But, bearing in mind C. S. Lewis's admonition, 'It is a good rule, after reading a new book, never to allow yourself another new one till you have read an old one in between,' this series will fill a great need that many of us may not even be aware of--the need to read those who have gone before us." (D. Stuart Briscoe)<br><br>"We speak abstractly in scholarly circles of the need to transcend looking at Christianity through the spectrum of modern presuppositions. This series, based on the commentaries of early Christians, gives us a concrete way to do this. It's a great idea." (Don S. Browning, Alexander Campbell Professor of Ethics and Social Sciences, The Divinity School, University of Chicago)<br><br>"The Scriptures have been read with love and attention for nearly two thousand years, and listening to the voice of believers from previous centuries opens us to unexpected insight and deepened faith. Those who studied Scripture in the centuries closest to its writing, the centuries during and following persecution and martyrdom, speak with particular authority. The Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture will bring to life the truth that we are invisibly surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses." (Frederica Mathewes-Green, commentator, National Public Radio)<br><br>"Composed in the style of the great medieval <em>catenae,</em> this new anthology of patristic commentary on Holy Scripture, conveniently arranged by chapter and verse, will be a valuable resource for prayer, study and proclamation. By calling attention to the rich Christian heritage preceding the separations between East and West and between Protestant and Catholic, this series will perform a major service to the cause of ecumenism."

He revolutionized the way we see natural selection in the seminal bestseller <i>The Selfish Gene</i>. Now, he launches a fierce counterattack against proponents of "Intelligent Design" in his <i>New York Times </i>bestseller, <i>The Greatest Show on Earth</i>.<br><br>"Intelligent Design" is being taught in our schools; educators are being asked to "teach the controversy" behind evolutionary theory. There is no controversy. Dawkins sifts through rich layers of scientific evidence&#x2014;from living examples of natural selection to clues in the fossil record; from natural clocks that mark the vast epochs wherein evolution ran its course to the intricacies of developing embryos; from plate tectonics to molecular genetics&#x2014;to make the airtight case that "we find ourselves perched on one tiny twig in the midst of a blossoming and flourishing tree of life and it is no accident, but the direct consequence of evolution by non-random selection." His unjaded passion for the natural world turns what might have been a negative argument, exposing the absurdities of the creationist position, into a positive offering to the reader: nothing less than a master&#x2019;s vision of life, in all its splendor.</p><p>With this tremendous follow-up to his blockbuster The God Delusion, Richard Dawkins takes advocates of intelligent design by the scruff of the neck and unfolds the evidence for evolution with characteristic panache. In a world in which Creationism is being taught in schools and educators are being asked to "teach the controversy" behind evolution, a delightfully exasperated Dawkins has decided to explain how it all really works. <p> In visceral, crystalline prose, Dawkins sets up each creatonist objection to evolution and takes it to task, bit by bit destroying the idea that the natural world needed an intelligent designer. But this is more than an argument. This is a thrilling tour into our distant past and into the interstices of all life on earth. Taking listeners through the case for evolution step-by-step, Dawkins looks at DNA (Fingerprints, Footprints, and Bloodstains), selective breeding (Wolf Pygmalion) anatomical similarity (The Kindred Garden and the Tree of Ancestry), molecular family trees (Molecular Minuet) geography (The Ark of the Continents), fossils (No rabbits in the Pre-Cambrian) vestiges and imperfections (Past Imperfect), a catchall q&amp;a (The Handy Dandy Creation Refuter), the stages of human evolution (Portraits of Grancestors), and the formula for a strong scientific theorytearing down the Intelligent Design theory in the process. This will be the last word in the evolution debate, and it will add God Delusion fans to the already science-hungry audience who bought the latest Steven Pinker or devoured Bill Bryson's The History of Nearly Everything. </p><p> The God Delusion stimulated, even set the terms of, one of the world's most vigorous public debates: the question of God's existence. The Greatest Show on Earth will provide listeners with the tools to join this vital debate effectively. And Dawkins' infectious passion for the world's beauty will convert all but the most doctrinaire creationists.</p><b>Richard Dawkins</b> is a Fellow of the Royal Society and was the inaugural holder of the Charles Simonyi Chair of Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University.

They buy sensible "starter homes" and plan to parley them into impressive dream houses through smart real estate deals, all the while deftly juggling their home, family and business lives. If two incomes don't cover all life's necessities -- and necessary luxuries -- their credit cards serve as readily available genies to make wishes reality. If their ultimate rewards have always been clear -- an early and comfortable retirement and a healthy estate to leave for the children -- why are they now facing the future with fear and trepidation?In <em>Die Broke: A Radical Four-Part Financial Plan </em>&nbsp; (HarperBusiness; November 1997; $25.00), financial advisers Stephen M. Pollan and Mark Levine explain the economic realities that have rendered the old rules obsolete and offer an innovative approach to financial planning that focuses on getting the maximum use out of your income and your assets during your lifetime and renouncing the foolish (and futile) quest for financial immortality. From the startling recommendation, "quit now," to the heretical "die broke," Pollan lays out the details of a complete financial revolution.</p><p>"Viewing yourself and your work as one," Pollan writes, "is a tremendous financial and emotional risk." To prove that the "Self-Fulfillment Ethic" and the false belief in careers must give way to a new work ethic, Pollan cites a ready role model -- the professional athlete. Free agents in the sports world know their tenure with any team is temporary and concentrate on getting the best financial deal they can. Adopting their attitude is the key for anyone who doesn't want to remain on the sidelines in the next century. Pollan advises that work is not a holistic pursuit. The only way to increase satisfaction and/or income is to job hop with a constant eye toward a work setting that will increase skills (and therefore marketability) and improve quality of life with immediate advantages like premium health insurance, company day care, parental leave and telecommuting and flex time options. "Long term benefits, like pension plans," Pollan reminds readers, "are worthless. Most of you will be fired long before you are fully vested."</p><p> What else is keeping people locked in the 20th century? Two little pieces of plastic: ATM cards and credit cards. The convenience is irresistible; the costs are mind-boggling. Offering a strong dose of reality, Pollan insists that spending should be difficult and uncomfortable: "You must resolve to no longer reach beyond your grasp. If you don't have the cash on hand or in your checking account to buy something... don't buy it."</p><p>Pollan issues an equally important warning about the biggest purchase most people make in their lives -- real estate. Home-ownership remains an excellent tax shelter and a desirable form of enforced savings that can help generate income in later years. But with the unpredictability of the real estate market, the benefits of "serial ownership," or "trading up," have become less likely. Pollan's solution is to save your money until you can "buy your second home first," by purchasing a residence that is large enough to accommodate a growing family, aging parents and even a home business -- in short, a home designed for a lifetime. </p><p> Along with demanding a new perspective on work, credit and real estate, the new economic age lays to rest the American "dream" of retirement. Not only are traditional sources of retirement money (government assistance and private pensions) drying up, but people have discovered that long-term leisure isn't all it's cracked up to be. Pollan encourages readers to shift their viewpoint and think about earned income the way they've always thought about unearned income: It may grow, stagnate or decrease. Investing and savings should be used to generate unearned income that will supplement on-going but fluctuating earnings. Among his recommendations: Keep a liquid reserve (in Certificates of Deposit, for example), pile up tax free savings by taking full advantage of IRAs, Keoghs, SEPs or 401(k)s, stick with equity investments like stock mutual funds far longer than traditionalists recommend, insure your income with top-notch health and disability coverage and protect your family with term life insurance that gives them enough to get by so they can adjust to the loss of your income. </p><p>There's one last obstacle to living well now and in the future: the obsession with inheritance. Like retirement, the desire to establish an estate is a hold-over from an earlier age and leads to unnecessary sacrifices that far outweigh any future benefits. Asserting that "every dollar that's left in your bank account after you die is a dollar wasted," Pollan outlines a plan that enables you to die broke while guaranteeing that you don't out-live your assets. His plan includes what kind of annuities to invest in for a maximum flow of income, the best ways to share your money with loved ones while you're still alive, how to get paid for living in your house and the ins-and-outs of Medicaid, Medigap, long-term care insurance and other vehicles for covering expenses at the end of life1s journey. </p><p> Recognizing that accepting a theory is one thing and putting it into practice another, Pollan provides an invaluable examination of 63 different career and financial topics from the <em>Die Broke</em>&nbsp; perspective. Throughout the book, Pollan specifies the optimum times to pursue various financial options, but stresses that it is possible to go back and accomplish most objectives before moving on to the next phase or to hold off on a step until you meet the criteria he discusses. The good news is it's never too early and never too late to live well and DIE BROKE.</p><p></p></p><p>Baby boomers, forget all you've learned from your parents about managing your money, your career, and your life. In <i>Die Broke</i>, Stephan Pollan challenges readers to rethink their notions of workplace, money, retirement, and inheritance. He believes that most of us are rooted in thinking that's out of sync with the realities of today's economy. For example, according to Pollan, the "job" is not what it used to be--there's no such thing as corporate loyalty. Making it in today's workplace means putting your own interests first, not your company's. Pollan argues that you should do your best at work, but make sure you're getting the best deal financially. If you're not, then get another job. After all, it's only a job. <p><i>Die Broke</i> is organized into two sections: the first lays out the principles for dying broke. Pollan bases his whole argument on these four maxims: quit today and work for yourself, not your company; pay cash, melt your credit cards, and don't even think about using your ATM card; don't retire, retirement is a relatively new concept created during the Depression, instead plan to work all your life, and; die broke, after all, you can't take it with you. </p><p>The second part looks at specific instances of how to put this philosophy into action, covering everything from "Automated Teller Machines and Cards" and "Umbrella Liability Insurance" to "Mortgage Loans" and "Real Estate Investment Trusts." The book draws on Pollan's experience as a financial and legal consultant and includes many examples from his own practice. </p><p> Some may find Pollan's views extreme. However, if you're starting to think about retirement or are at all worried about your financial future, <i>Die Broke</i> is worth a look. Even if you think you've got it all figured out, this book could change your mind.</p><p>Stephen M.

Tour.</p><p>David M. Oshinsky is Professor of History at Rutgers University.An absorbing tale of a Southern prison whose name is synonymous with brutality. Historian Oshinsky (A Conspiracy So Immense, 1983) draws on materials ranging from court records and blues lyrics of black women prisoners to the novels of William Faulkner for this thoroughgoing history of Parchman Farm, Miss., a 20,000-acre plantation notorious even among the most hardened criminals for its inhumane conditions. Oshinsky traces Parchman Farm's evolution during Mississippi's frontier days, when lawlessness and violence made the later Wild West seem tame by comparison, and after the Civil War, when civic society broke down and a fifth of the state budget went to the purchase of artificial limbs for broken--and desperate--veterans who too often wound up behind bars. A disproportionate number of Parchman's residents, however, were black, and Oshinsky is particularly good at tracing the decline of African-American fortunes in the late 19th century, when, as a contemporary observer noted, ``however these [white Mississippians] may have regarded the negro slave, they hated the negro freeman.'' White Mississippians reasserted their power through the courts, fostering a system of work farming whereby Parchman inmates (often mere children who had committed such crimes as stealing change from the counter of a dry-goods store) were rented out as near-slave labor for neighboring cotton plantations--a system that ended only in the mid-20th century. Oshinsky examines the culture of what he calls this ``American Siberia,'' drawing heavily on oral histories collected by federal workers in the New Deal era, to show how thoroughly that culture influenced the larger society of the Deep South. In a charged epilogue, Oshinsky notes that Parchman, now a ``scientifically run'' prison, is resisting pressures to institute chain-gang labor, setting something of a standard of humane treatment for the region. A well-paced, revealing history of hard times. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He builds his case carefully, explaining the methods and objectives of archaeology before reviewing and interpreting the record. Rather than upholding the myth of a determined group fighting against overwhelming odds, Fox shows that Custer's defeat resulted from the sudden disintegration of tactical stability--there was no "last stand." Fox provides a framework in which history and archaeology as equal partners can be used to analyze battles; his results are clear and accessible to the lay reader as well as the specialist.

Even more amazing, after it's unearthed the artifact releases a powerful signal aimed at Saturn. What sort of alarm has been triggered? To find out, a manned spacecraft, the <i>Discovery</i>, is sent to investigate. Its crew is highly trained--the best--and they are assisted by a self-aware computer, the ultra-capable HAL 9000. But HAL's programming has been patterned after the human mind a little too well. He is capable of guilt, neurosis, even murder, and he controls every single one of <i>Discovery</i>'s components. The crew must overthrow this digital psychotic if they hope to make their rendezvous with the entities that are responsible not just for the monolith, but maybe even for human civilization.<p> Clarke wrote this novel while Stanley Kubrick created the film, the two collaborating on both projects.

Fully grounded in sound literary and historical scholarship, the anthology takes a fresh approach to many canonical authors, and includes a wide selection of work by lesser-known writers. The anthology also provides wide-ranging coverage of the worldwide connections of British literature, and it pays attention throughout to issues of race, gender, class, and sexual orientation. It includes comprehensive introductions to each period, providing in each case an overview of the historical and cultural as well as the literary background. It features accessible and engaging headnotes for all authors, extensive explanatory annotations throughout, and an unparalleled number of illustrations and contextual materials, offering additional perspectives both on individual texts and on larger social and cultural developments. Innovative, authoritative, and comprehensive, The Broadview Anthology of British Literature embodies a consistently fresh approach to the study of literature and literary history.

But not for all. Academic social scientists such as Richard T. Ely, John R. Commons, and Edward A. Ross, together with their reform allies in social work, charity, journalism, and law, played a pivotal role in establishing minimum-wage and maximum-hours laws, workmen's compensation, antitrust regulation, and other hallmarks of the regulatory welfare state. But even as they offered uplift to some, economic progressives advocated exclusion for others, and did both in the name of progress. Leonard meticulously reconstructs the influence of Darwinism, racial science, and eugenics on scholars and activists of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, revealing a reform community deeply ambivalent about America's poor. <i>Illiberal Reformers </i>shows that the intellectual champions of the regulatory welfare state proposed using it not to help those they portrayed as hereditary inferiors but to exclude them.</p></p><p><p>"Mythologies that arise around individuals, groups, and ideas of the past tend to mask many warts. Thomas Leonard's excellent book about American economics during the Progressive Era shows how progressives' efforts to champion reform drew on a vision of scientific development that would institutionalize the eugenic creed and, in the process, do great violence to the liberal project that had been at the heart of the American system. <i>Illiberal Reformers</i> provides a powerful lesson in the tensions that surround ideals of social progress, scientific expertise, and the democratic system."<b>--Steven G. Medema, University of Colorado, Denver</b></p><p>"Economists like to think of their ancestors as heroic seekers of truth, each generation, as Newton suggested, standing on the shoulders of the giants who came before. Thomas Leonard demonstrates clearly that the story of economics in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century America was far more complex--and more interesting. He shows how the economists of that era combined their passion for social reform with religion, eugenics, and evolution theory in ways that seem incredible today. This book is an eye-opener."<b>--Craufurd Goodwin, James B. Duke Professor of Economics Emeritus, Duke University</b></p><p>"This untold story of how Progressive Era activists helped construct the extensive role of government in the economy sheds light on today's technocratic dilemmas. Which decisions need to be left to experts, the &#x2018;social engineers,' and which require democratic participation? Thomas Leonard's book demonstrates that during the Progressive Era this question was resolved only by combining democratic reform with the exclusion of women, African Americans, immigrants, and disabled people as full members of society. It underlines the fact that the tension between &#x2018;expert' economic administration and individual liberties remains at the heart of current political debates."<b>--Diane Coyle, author of <i>GDP: A Brief but Affectionate History</i></b></p><p>"<i>Illiberal Reformers</i> makes a substantial contribution to the much contested history of U.S. progressivism by providing fascinating new evidence of what Leonard terms its &#x2018;dark side.' This book's rich narrative will amply reward readers interested in the discrete histories of social science, science, politics, culture, industrial relations, and general U.S. history, and offers a wealth of new material on discrimination based on gender, race, and class."<b>--Mary O.

She is the Florence Kelley Professor of History at New York University and lives in New York and Madison, Wisconsin.[Signature]<i>Reviewed by</i> Kirstin DowneyHistorian Linda Gordon presents us with a portrait of the artist as a woman in her fascinating new biography of photographer Dorothea Lange [1895&#x2013;1965], who captured the images of Americans on the move during the Great Depression.Lange's most famous picture features a migrant woman in California, a refugee from the Dust Bowl. She sits by the side of the road in her lean-to tent, her children draped on her body, hanging from her haggard frame like dead weights, as she stoically looks out into the distance.But the book's central focus is the journey made by the woman standing behind the camera lens. Lange was raised on New York City's Lower East Side and overcame obstacles almost from the start. During her childhood, her parents separated, which Dorothea experienced as a desertion by her father, and a bout of childhood polio left her with a permanent limp. She spotted an opportunity, however, in photography, which was a burgeoning new art field. Dorothea apprenticed herself to a master to learn the craft, giving herself a new identity. She dropped her childhood name, Dorothea Nutzhorn, and adopted her mother's maiden name instead.She further redefined herself after making a westward trek in 1918. Within two years, she emerged as a prosperous society photographer in San Francisco who specialized in portraiture of the city's elite, but that work dried up in the 1930s. Lange shifted course again, becoming a documentary photographer for New Deal programs. From 1935 to 1941, Lange was virtually a migrant worker herself, traveling from place to place, photographing farm workers in fields and primitive labor camps.Gordon wrestles with the issue of how Lange dealt with her role as a woman in a society where family burdens are disproportionately borne by females. Raising a large brood of children and stepchildren, Lange frequently had to put her own work aside to run the household. She also became the primary breadwinner for her first husband, cowboy artist Maynard Dixon, and later supported the career of her second husband, economist and diplomat Paul Taylor, despite her own failing health.Lange privately railed at her family obligations. She shipped the children away when their care conflicted with her schedule or that of her respective husbands. And sometimes she could be cruel: she took revenge on her adolescent stepdaughter, whose father dumped her in Dorothea's lap for months at a time, criticizing and carping at her and photographing her in ways that an adolescent girl would likely have found humiliating.Dorothea Lange's talented eye brings the Great Depression home for us even today, but an observer might suggest that Dorothea, despite her fame and talent, was as much a captive of a woman's societal roles as the migrant mother she so brilliantly photographed. <i>(Oct.)</i><i>Kirstin Downey is a former staff writer at the</i>Washington Post <i>and author of</i> The Woman Behind the New Deal: The Life of Frances Perkins, FDR's Secretary of Labor and His Moral Conscience <i>(Doubleday/Talese).</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Annotation c. by Book News, Inc., Portland, Or.</p><p>The desolate Mojave Desert in Nevada&#39;s extreme southern tip is one of the least hospitable environments in the United States. However, its rugged mountains concealed rich deposits of gold and silver that attracted miners from the time that Spanish explorers first discovered them in the eighteenth century. In the early years of this century, the area became the site of a small but profitable mining boom. At the center of the excitement was a camp called Searchlight. Nevada&#39;s U.S. Senator Harry Reid is a native of Searchlight, and in this book he recounts the colorful history of his hometown - the discovery of the ores that brought about the boom, the growth of the mines and of the town that served them, and the lives of the hardy, stubborn people who not only worked the mines but with their families built a town from a dusty mining camp. He also reveals to us how the railroad and other transportation came to Searchlight, how the availability of water helped the town and its surrounding ranches grow, and the roles played by famous, and infamous, residents - such as the renegade Paiute Queho, Hollywood royalty like Clara Bow and Rex Bell, and aviation pioneer John Macready.Harry Reid was born in Searchlight to a local mining family.

You've changed what you wanted to do with your life every other year since you were a kid."<br><br>My dad is absolutely right. I've never been able to focus on any one thing for very long, and I still have trouble answering the question "What do you want to be when you grow up?" At first, I wanted to be Big Bird, road-tripping around the country in Follow That Bird. Then I wanted to be Mister Rogers. Once, my family was staying at a hotel, and Fred Rogers was there having breakfast. I ran right up to him and exclaimed, "Excuse me, Mister Rogers, Mister Rogers! How did you get out of the TV?!"<br><br>When I was in fourth grade, I wanted to be a play-by-play announcer for the Olympics. In eighth grade, I wanted to be Adam Sandler. In high school, I wanted to be a sports writer. Then I went to a liberal arts college, which is to say I majored in film studies, studied abroad in Cuba, and took intro to dance senior year. Making career choices has proved difficult ever since.<br><br>After graduation, I could write a fifteen-page shot-by-shot analysis of David Lynch's Mulholland Drive and tell you the difference between cage-free, free-range, and pasture-raised eggs. But I realized that college had not prepared me for the job-finding process in the slightest. Since I had no idea which "career ladder" to climb, I moved to the city where all my friends were moving (Brooklyn), and got a job that matched my college major (film), which is what I thought I was supposed to do at the time.<br><br>In the ten years since graduation, I've had ten drastically different jobs, lived in six cities, and gone down four career paths. I've never once seen this elusive "career ladder" everyone talks about. But I do know that whoever invented the ladder has been freaking twentysomethings out for a long time.<br><br>Where do you get on the ladder? Is there one in each city in the world? If you hop off for a detour, do you have to start back from the bottom, or do you get to keep your place in line? Is there music along the way? Is it like Pandora-can I choose my station?<br><br>As insufferable as this ladder mind-set can be, twentysomethings are still unfailingly being told to maintain a linear career trajectory. Even my father, who was born in the 1950s, hasn't followed any sort of career path. He has worked in stage management and lighting design for off-off-Broadway shows, then for a rock 'n' roll theater start-up in London, dropped out of NYU's theater school, sailed across the Atlantic, joined Pink Floyd as a roadie doing lighting on their international tours, became disenchanted with life on the road and enrolled in architecture school, worked as an architect, raised kids, spent time in corporate real estate, got his MBA at the age of fifty-three, built dialysis clinics, and managed projects and workplace innovation for a large electronics company. Yet even he was skeptical when I told him I wasn't pursuing a "traditional" career path after college, and instead was headed to New York to freelance on film sets.<br><br>If you've struggled with picking a career path, or focusing on one interest or calling, then you're not alone.

The first is what I'll call the career ladder mind-set, the one we've been taught to follow most of our lives. This mind-set tells us that the more AP classes we take, the better we do on our SATs, the better college we go to, the more money we make, the higher on the ladder we rise, the more successful we are.<br><br>Someone with this mind-set would look at my career and say, "This kid Smiley is a hot mess; he lived at his parents' house at the age of twenty-seven! He can't make up his mind. He won't stay in a job for more than two years. He'll never be successful because he's not on a specific career ladder. Think of where he could have been if he had spent the last eight years in film."<br><br>Although recent college graduates are often encouraged to adopt a career ladder mind-set, these career ladders have several essential flaws:<br><br>Career ladders limit new opportunities, experimentation, and risk taking. What happens if an amazing opportunity presents itself-say, to join the 2008 Obama campaign-and I want to get off the ladder, but I've already spent two years on a different career? Ladders encourage people to avoid new challenges in exchange for safety and "moving up." Avoiding these risks may mean avoiding the very opportunities that provide us the greatest satisfaction in life. If there isn't only one answer, there probably isn't one "top of the ladder," either.<br><br>Career ladders define success on someone else's terms. Career ladders lead to promotion potential and higher salary. The theory is, "Pay your dues early, and you'll reap the benefits later." I'm not a huge fan of delayed gratification in general-not many millennials are-but it's especially annoying when I don't even get to define what my gratification is or what success means to me. What happens if I'm not in it for a fancy job title or a big salary? What happens if success for me is not my retirement package at sixty-five, but one person realizing their life potential from a book I write?<br><br>Career ladders make me stress about the future, which inhibits me from taking action now. When I was thinking about leaving my job at the Peace Corps, one of the things I was interested in pursuing next was writing. Whenever I brought up the possibility of becoming a freelance writer, all I heard from people was, "Well, it's a hard career ladder to climb. You can't get a staff writing position at a major newspaper anymore. Newspapers don't even exist. The New Yorker receives one hundred thousand submissions an hour."<br><br>To some degree, the people warning me not to go into freelance writing at the age of twenty-eight were right: writing is extremely competitive, and it's the opposite of financially lucrative. But stressing about my future career as a writer and about where I'd end up ten or twenty years down the road nearly stopped me from even trying. I hadn't even written a blog post yet, and I was thinking about writing for The New Yorker. I was stressing about the future, instead of taking action now.<br><br>The best advice I got about starting a writing career was from my friend Ryan Goldberg, a freelance journalist who lives in Brooklyn and has numerous bylines in The New York Times. At the time we talked, Ryan was also refereeing dodgeball to supplement his income. He told me, "Smiley, if you want to be a writer, write. Start writing today."<br><br>Stop Climbing Ladders, Start Jumping Lily Pads<br><br>The other way of looking at my career is through what I'll call the lily pad career mind-set. My friend and career strategist Nathaniel Koloc sometimes describes careers as a series of lily pads, extending in all directions. Each lily pad is a job or opportunity that's available, and you can jump in any direction that makes sense for you, given your purpose (how you want to help the world). Nathaniel founded ReWork, a talent firm that places purpose-seeking professionals in social impact jobs, and then served as director of talent for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. He has made it his job to study how people build careers worth having.<br><br>Nathaniel says, "There is no clear way 'up' anymore-it's just a series of projects or jobs, one after another. You can move in any direction; the only question is how you're devising your strategy of where to move and where you can 'land,' i.e., what you're competitive for."<br><br>Leaping to another lily pad for a new job or opportunity doesn't mean you're going backward. There is no backward. You can't go backward if you're learning. The lily pad career mind-set argues that motivated people who want to align their work with their purpose should consider frequent small career jumps based on their changing purpose and interests. This is especially important in a difficult job market that requires job seekers to constantly evolve and develop new skills to remain competitive.<br><br>Which of the following scenarios inspires you to take action?<br><br>1. Spending ten to twenty years going in one specific direction, climbing a ladder until someone else tells you that you are "successful."<br><br>2. Spending ten to twenty years exploring multiple lily pads, learning and experimenting as you go, seeking fulfillment as defined by the unique contribution you want to make.<br><br>Leaping between lily pads means you're getting closer to wherever your roots, your interests, and your learning desires are pulling you. Motivated people who want to align their work with their purpose should embrace flexibility and experimentation when it comes to their careers. This doesn't mean that you have to quit your job every two years, but it does mean that you have to consistently check in to see if what you're working on excites you or is making a valuable contribution.<br><br>Instead of one ladder leading straight up, the lily pad career mind-set visualizes your career as a pond of lily pads, a series of interconnecting leaps you've made between different opportunities. What's holding everything together is the roots: what you care about and how you want to help the world. In my case, today my roots are driving me to inspire others through writing, speaking, and helping others to realize their full potential. Your roots may be driving you to do one thing now, but that thing may change in five years.<br><br>Your education doesn't stop when you graduate from college; in fact, a whole new aspect of it begins the day you enter the workforce. Rather than simply checking a box for your major at the age of twenty, when you barely know what your university has to offer (let alone what life has to offer), accept that you're going to be a lifelong learner. Instead of climbing a career ladder that might not be around in five or ten years, treat your career like a lifelong experiment. Every job, every experience, every place you travel, is a chance to learn something new about yourself, what interests you (and, importantly, what doesn't), what you're good at, and what type of impact you want to have on the world.<br><br>Our new economy is characterized by rapid technological innovation. How we communicate and how we work are constantly changing in an increasingly global job market. The US Department of Labor has noted that 65 percent of today's grade school kids will end up in jobs that haven't been invented yet. Whether they want to or not, fewer and fewer people are staying in one job for a long period of time. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2014 the median job tenure for twenty- to twenty-four-year-olds was less than 1.5 years, for twenty-five- to thirty-four-year-olds it was only three years, and for all workers twenty-five and over it was 5.5 years. If the majority of millennials are staying in their jobs for less than three years, that means some will have four jobs by the age of thirty, and as many as fifteen to twenty jobs in their lifetime.<br><br>In an article about "generation flux" and how to succeed in this new business climate, Robert Safian, editor of Fast Company, argues that we need a mind-set that embraces instability and recalibrating careers. "Our institutions are out of date," he writes. "The long career is dead; any quest for solid rules is pointless, since we will be constantly rethinking them; you can't rely on an established business model or a corporate ladder to point your way; silos between industries are breaking down; anything settled is vulnerable."<br><br>Pay Attention When Your Purpose Changes<br><br>The story of my friend Ryan Allis teaches us that it's never too late to adopt a lily pad career mind-set. Ryan became an entrepreneur at the age of eleven when his family moved to Bradenton, Florida, where a large percentage of the neighbors were over the age of sixty-five. Ryan's Uncle Steve sent him one of his old Macintosh computers, and Ryan learned everything he could about the computer, played SimCity for hours, and read PC World cover to cover. He felt as ready as an eleven-year-old could ever be, so he created a flyer that said, "Need computer help? For $5 an hour, a responsible eleven-year-old will come to your house. Call Ryan." His parents even let him get his own landline number to advertise on the flyers, which he posted around the neighborhood, at the library, at the laundromat, at city hall, and in people's mailboxes.<br><br>Ryan's first call wasn't from a potential customer, it was from the local postmaster, who asked to speak to his parents. The postmaster general was upset at Ryan's mom for letting her son put flyers in mailboxes without paying for stamps. "That was the first important lesson I learned about entrepreneurship: sometimes you have to act first and ask permission later," recalls Ryan. "It's okay to push the boundaries a little bit."<br><br>A few weeks later, Ryan made his first sale. He rode his bike to help an older man named Jim with his computer for an hour. Jim paid him $10 (double his rate), and then told his buddies at the bingo hall about Ryan. Soon Ryan was receiving lots of calls from other senior citizens in the neighborhood, and he began showing them how to set up AOL and send pictures to their grandchildren. Ryan made $400 that summer before seventh grade, and by the end of high school he was making $1,000 a month as a freelance web designer.</p><h2>Natural Strategies for Cancer Patients</h2><p><b>THE BEST WAYS TO FIGHT CANCER AND HEAL YOUR BODY NATURALLY</b><br> &nbsp;<br> This revised, updated edition of Russell L.

Traditional top-down organizations are like spiders, but now starfish organizations are changing the face of business and the world. <br><br> What?s the hidden power behind the success of Wikipedia, craigslist, and Skype? What do eBay and General Electric have in common with the abolitionist and women?s rights movements? What fundamental choice put General Motors and Toyota on vastly different paths? <br><br> Ori Brafman and Rod Beckstrom have discovered some unexpected answers, gripping stories, and a tapestry of unlikely connections. <i>The Starfish and the Spider</i> explores what happens when starfish take on spiders and reveals how established companies and institutions, from IBM to Intuit to the U.S. government, are also learning how to incorporate starfish principles to achieve success.</p><p><b>Advance praise for <i>The Starfish and the Spider</i></b> <br><br> "The Starfish and the Spider is a compelling and important book, rich with examples of how decentralization is fundamental to what I call the 'right environment'--one that promotes equal access, rich connections and 'skin in the game' for participants."<br> --Pierre Omidyar CEO, Omidyar Network; Founder and Chairman, eBay Inc. <br><br> "The Starfish and the Spider, like Blink, The Tipping Point, and The Wisdom of Crowds before it, showed me a provocative new way to look at the world and at business. It's also fun to read! It's a quick read, but a profound one. Every CEO should think about what aspects of catalyst leadership they embody, or can embody, for the good of their company."<br> --Robin Wolaner, author of Naked in the Boardroom <br><br> "A fantastic read. Constantly weaving stories and connections. You'll never see the world the same way again."<br> --Nicholas J. Nicholas, Former Co-CEO of Time-Warner <br><br> "A must read. Starfish are changing the face of business and society. This page-turner is provocative and compelling."<br> --David Martin, CEO of YPO International <br><br> "Starfish provides a powerful perceptual prism for understanding the patterns and potential of self-organizing systems."<br> --Steve Jurvetson, Partner, Draper Fisher Jurvetson <br><br> "Starfish lifts the lid on a massive revolution in the making, a revolution certain to reshape every organization on the planet from bridge clubs to global governments. Brafman and Beckstrom elegantly describe what is afoot and and offer a wealth of insights that will be invaluable to anyone starting something new--or rescuing something old--amidst this vast shift."<br> --Paul Saffo Director, Institute For The Future <br><br> "The Starfish and the Spider is great reading. [It has] not only stimulated my thinking, but as a result of the reading, I proposed ten action points for my own organization."<br> --Klaus Schwab, Executive Chairman, World Economic Forum, Davos <br><br> "Starfish challenges the command and control economy with the power of participatory consumers. From eBay to Google, Skype to Craig's List, inspired individuals are catalyzing a marked shift from hierarchies to the wisdom of crowds. Ori and Rod provide sharp insights into how to avoid becoming the next victim of this market populism; or if you are so inclined, the strategies to take on those vulnerable incumbents."<br> --Randy Komisar, Author, Stanford Professor, and Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers Partner <br><br> "I just read The Starfish and the Spider a second time. I am writing a Board paper asking my Board to approve a completely new top management structure. I have borrowed heavily from your thoughts, and feel even in an age-old bricks and mortar industry, we can apply some of the leaderless organization rules to grow faster and be significant to our members and our communities."<br> --Pradeep Paunrana, CEO, Athi River Mining, Ltd., publicly listed Kenya Company <br><br> "It is my pleasure to endorse The Starfish and the Spider by Ori Brafman and Rod Beckstrom. Reading The Starfish and the Spider is like jumping into the minds of two visionaries who can see possibilities for our world that others can not hope to even imagine. But the great thrill of this book is that these two authors are visionaries who have already achieved extraordinary accomplishments in this world - they know how to make visions incarnate. That's why you need to read this book. They see the world the way it can be."<br> --Caroline Myss, Author of Anatomy of the Spirit and Sacred Contracts <br><br> "In addition to being highly readable and highly entertaining, Beckstrom and Brafman make a strong case for the leaderless organization, an approach that is too often unappreciated in today's world."<br> --Robert Leaf, Former Chairman, Burson Marsteller International <br><br> "The Starfish and the Spider is an intelligent and compellingly written exposition of the importance of decentralization in our lives, culture and economy. The authors' weaving of neurochemistry with economics sociology and psychology entertained and educated me and will do the same for anyone who wants to learn."<br> --Frederic Luskin, Ph.D. Director Stanford Forgiveness Projects... Author Forgive for Good <br><br> "Starfish represents an important framework for understanding and mastering distributed leadership."<br> --David Whorton, Managing Director, Tugboat Ventures <br><br> "How do you *think* about running your organization in a world where customers openly share their opinions of your business without you controlling the dialog? Is your mentality starfish or spider driven? Read about insightful examples and consequences of paths companies, governments, and social groups have pursued."<br> --Edward A. Smith, VP of Marketing, Clickshift <br><br> "Before I read The Starfish and The Spider, I often felt like I was bobbing alone in a sea of old ideas in how I chose to manifest and guide an organization or project. Now my instincts are affirmed and I go forth with greater insight, confidence and words to articulate my ideas. And of course, I am on the lookout for other starfish."<br> --Kimberly Carlisle, The Carlisle Enterprise and The Flag Foundation <br><br> "This book explains clearly and simply the power of decentralized organization. If decentralized organization sounds like an oxymoron, read on! This is a powerful new organizational model and Brafman and Beckstrom demonstrate how and why it is taking industries by storm."<br> --Steve Farrell, Former CEO, Enterprise Networking Systems Inc. <br><br> "This is one of those books that is so striking, that I keep bringing it up in conversations. As the head of an international nonprofit, the insights into non-hierarchical organizations are not just valuable, they're essential to our work in the future."<br> --Jim Fruchterman CEO, Benetech <br><br> "I'd suggest adding to the list the upcoming The Starfish and the Spider: The Unstoppable Power of Leaderless Organizations, by Ori Brafman and Rod Beckstrom. It's another great look at how we can often be more effective by subverting hierarchy rather than following it."<br> --Scott Allen The Ubiquitous Librarian *Blog <br><br> "I actually finished it within 48 hours of receiving it, but wanted to re-read and think about it more...it is amazing and continues to give me much to consider - something happens every other day that makes me think about the concepts.

Nevertheless, many teachers end up using language patterns that undermine these goals. Do any of these scenarios sound familiar?</p> <ul><li>We want students to take responsibility for their learning, yet we use language that implies teacher ownership. </li><li>We want to build positive relationships with students, yet we use sarcasm when we get frustrated. </li><li>We want students to think learning is fun, yet we sometimes make comments that suggest the opposite. </li><li>We want students to exhibit good behavior because it's the right thing to do, yet we rely on threats and bribes, which implies students don't naturally want to be good.</li></ul> <p>What teachers say to students--when they praise or discipline, give directions or ask questions, and introduce concepts or share stories--affects student learning and behavior. A slight change in intonation can also dramatically change how language feels for students. In <em>What We Say and How We Say It Matter, </em> Mike Anderson digs into the nuances of language in the classroom. This book's many examples will help teachers examine their language habits and intentionally improve their classroom practice so their language matches and supports their goals.</p></p><p>Greetings, reader!&nbsp;<br>The language educators use with students is so important. I have been thinking about the language of teaching for a long time. As a new teacher, I realized that some of my language habits didn't match my best intentions. Some honest feedback from a student helped me understand that the joking and teasing that I thought built rapport was sometimes confusing (and even hurtful) for some of my students. It took me a few years to realize that the way I praised students by making everything about me ("I love the way you're working so hard." "I like how quietly you're walking in the halls!" "Thanks so much for working together so well.") encouraged kids to work for me instead of themselves.<br>I was also fortunate to have some powerful mentors early in my career who helped me examine (and change) some of my language. Marlynn Clayton, Ruth Charney, and Paula Denton were colleagues of mine when I worked with the Responsive Classroom approach to teaching who were greatly influential. Paula's book, The Power of Our Words, along with Peter Johnston's book, Choice Words, helped me continue my reflective journey.<br>As a consultant working in many schools, I have found myself supporting teachers' thinking about language a lot. Whether the topic is differentiation, social and emotional learning, classroom management, or something else, language is always an important topic to explore.<br>After many years of thinking about it, I finally decided it was time to write a book about it! My goal is to help teachers bring their language more in line with their best intentions. After all, we all have positive goals and want the best for our students, don't we? And don't we also all end up using at least some language patterns that don't totally line up with these good intentions? As an educator and a parent, I still have language goals I'm working on--there's always room for growth. I hope that if you get this book it is both thought-provoking and enjoyable. I hope that it helps you continue to grow as an educator so you can create the kinds of safe, exciting, challenging, and joyful learning environments that all kids deserve!<br>-Mike Anderson<p><strong>Mike Anderson</strong> has been an educator for more than 25 years.

With a lot of insight and common sense, Gray tackles the hard and often messy business of finding "a soul mate." Without fear or favor, <i>Mars and Venus on a Date</i> dissects the dynamics between men and women and the five stages each relationship must pass through: attraction, uncertainty, exclusivity, intimacy, and, finally, engagement (for marriage, of course). Even though <i>Mars and Venus on a Date</i> isn't <i>The Rules</i> by a long shot, the courtship it describes is surprisingly old-fashioned. It's chock-full of things your mother might say: "Most people find or are found by their soul mates when they are not really looking." "The man should never talk more than the woman." But how to know if the person you're with is your "soul mate?" Gray writes, "When our soul wants to marry our partner, it feels like a promise that we came into this world to keep." Which translates into, "When you know, you know."<i>Mars and Venus on a Date</i> is for all single people looking for love, including the newly separated or divorced who are daunted by re-entering the singles scene. Written with the compassion and understanding that could come only from John Gray, it takes readers through the five stages of dating: Attraction, Ambivalence, Commitment (to monogamy), True Intimacy and Proposal/Marriage. In its pages, readers will find creative ideas on finding a soulmate, making a commitment and sage advice on such difficult issues as deciding when to become sexually intimate and whether or not to live with their partner. <p> The singles universe can be a nebulous and frightening place, and the men and women alone in this void have great need for the wisdom of John Gray. In the same way that <i>Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus</i> became the ultimate relationship book for couples, <i>Mars and Venus on a Date</i> will be the singles' essential guide.</p></p><h2>Vietnamese Home Cooking: [A Cookbook]</h2><p><b>In his eagerly awaited first cookbook, award-winning chef Charles Phan from San Francisco's Slanted Door restaurant introduces traditional Vietnamese cooking to home cooks by focusing on fundamental techniques and ingredients.<br></b><br>When Charles Phan opened his now-legendary restaurant, The Slanted Door, in 1995, he introduced American diners to a new world of Vietnamese food: robustly flavored, subtly nuanced, authentic yet influenced by local ingredients, and, ultimately, entirely approachable.

TOYLAND EXPRESS, the eighth title in the bestselling search-and-find series, follows the life of a toy train from the workshop to the attic, only to be rescued at a yard sale and brought to life once again in a new home. As readers search for more than 250 hidden objects, they will also notice how the train takes on various transformations along its journey.</p><p>Walter Wick is the photographer of the bestselling I Spy series as well as the author and photographer of the bestselling Can You See What I See? series. He lives with his wife, Linda, in Connecticut.Booklist Advanced Review, November 2011: <br>Wick\u2019s latest seek-and-find book begins in a toymaker\u2019s workshop, where an unpainted wooden train set <br>and many other wooden toys and parts can be seen. A rhyme challenges children to find 20 things among <br>the hundreds of tiny objects. The next 11 double-page spreads follow the toys\u2019 progression as they are <br>painted, displayed in a shop, received on a birthday, left on a bedroom floor, and repurposed in scenes <br>involving a snowy mountain, a circus, and a dollhouse. Forgotten in an attic, they reemerge at a yard sale, <br>receive repairs, and find new life in a toy-land cityscape. Wick\u2019s puzzle design and picture composition <br>are as masterful as his photography. An appended note offers insight into the book\u2019s subject and <br>acknowledges the \u201cteam of artists\u201d who contributed to it. The handsome endpapers, depicting the toys in <br>soft-edged drawings washed with gentle colors, contrast nicely with the bright, crisply delineated photos. <br>Like other books in the Can You See What I See? series, this book offers practice in visual-discrimination <br>skills as well as a great deal of fun. <br>&#x2014; Carolyn Phelan <br><br><br>Kirkus Reviews, June 2011: <br>Complex seek-and-find images provide an intriguing backdrop for the story of a tenacious toy train. <br><br>This latest collection of picture puzzles in the Can You See What I See? series provides a nostalgic glimpse into the life, death and resurrection of a wooden train. The engine huffs from creation to exploration as it races past blocks, around dolls and through miniature villages. There's a vulnerable depth as the once-cherished birthday present is discarded in the dusty attic. Rescued in a yard sale and restored to its former beauty, the vehicle races with new purpose. The text follows a repetitive format as an inviting question encourages the eagle-eyed audience to peruse each page for items strategically placed within. Without effusive description, straightforward rhymes of concealed objects add to the challenge of the hunt. A direct title oversees each expansive double-page spread, and the pace naturally builds to repeated references to the train and its tumultuous journey. Wick plays with similar colors to enhance these expressive camouflaged spreads. Digitally processed photographs capture crisp dimensions with remarkable clarity. <br><br>No puzzle here&#x2014;these well-designed scenes are another success from the picture-challenge master.

Every other Saturday I spent the entire day at Dress for Success, a gently-used-clothing boutique. I loved dressing these ladies, whose courage inspired and stirred me. Many had come out of abusive relationships or were looking to get off welfare and find their place in the workforce. It was a joy to fit them with a wardrobe that gave them confidence and the hope that they could succeed.<br><br>&#x201c;Would you look at me?&#x201d; Shawntelle Maynor said, as she studied her reflection in the mirror. She turned around and glanced over her shoulder, nodding, apparently liking what she saw. &#x201c;This hides my butt good.&#x201d;<br><br>Shawntelle was a good five inches taller than my own five-foot-three frame. Her hair was an untamed mass of tight black curls raining down upon her shoulders. She critically studied herself in the outfit I&#x2019;d put together for her first job interview.<br><br>I found it hard to believe the difference clothes made. Shawntelle had arrived in baggy sweatpants and an oversized T-shirt. Now, dressed in black slacks and a pink Misook jacket, she looked like a million bucks.<br><br>&#x201c;Wowza.&#x201d; I stepped back and reviewed my handiwork. The transformation was stunning.<br><br>&#x201c;I need help with this hair,&#x201d; she said, frowning as she shoved it away from her face. &#x201c;I should have known better than to let Charise cut it. She was all confident she could do it after watching a YouTube video. I was crazy to let her anywhere close to my hair with a pair of scissors.&#x201d; Her fingers reached up and touched the uneven ends of her bangs, or what I assumed must be her bangs. &#x201c;I thought it&#x2019;d grow out, and it did, but now it looks even worse.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve already made you an appointment next door.&#x201d; The hairstylist in the shop next to Dress for Success volunteered to give each woman at the boutique a wash and cut before her job interview.<br><br>Shawntelle&#x2019;s eyes nearly popped out of her head. &#x201c;Get out of here. Really?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Really. When&#x2019;s your interview?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Monday afternoon.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your hair appointment is set for ten. Does that time work for you?&#x201d;<br><br>Her smile was answer enough. Shawntelle had recently graduated from an accounting class and was looking for her first job. She had five children and her husband had deserted the family. The agency had gotten her an interview with a local car dealership. She&#x2019;d gone through several practice interviews, which had given her a boost of confidence. Now, with the proper outfit, she beamed with self-assurance.<br><br>&#x201c;I never thought I&#x2019;d make it without LeRoy,&#x201d; she whispered. &#x201c;But I am and I refuse to let that cheatin&#x2019; scumbag back. He&#x2019;s screwed me over for the last time.&#x201d;<br><br>I smiled at the vehemence in her voice. I was walking this same rock-strewn path. In addition to my volunteer work, I was a substitute teacher for the Portland School District. My degree was in French literature with a minor in education, which qualified me for a teaching position. Unfortunately, no full-time positions were available, so I filled in as needed.<br><br>Thankfully, Leanne was available to watch Owen for me and as a backup there was a drop-in daycare center down the street from our apartment building. I eked by financially, in stark contrast to the lavish lifestyle I&#x2019;d become accustomed to while married.<br><br>I had to remind myself I was still technically married. The final papers had yet to be drawn up to Jake&#x2019;s satisfaction. My husband had made this divorce as difficult as possible, thinking he could change my mind. He&#x2019;d been persistently begging me to reconsider. When he finally realized my determination to see this through, he&#x2019;d set up every roadblock he could, dragging out the settlement hearings, arguing each point. Our attorney fees had skyrocketed.<br><br>Divorce is hard&#x2014;so much harder than I&#x2019;d ever imagined it would be.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll call after the interview?&#x201d; I asked Shawntelle, determinedly pushing thoughts of Jake out of my mind.<br><br>&#x201c;You got it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to do so well.&#x201d; I gave her arm a gentle squeeze.<br><br>Shawntelle turned and wrapped me in a hug. &#x201c;Them Kardashian chicks ain&#x2019;t got nothin&#x2019; on me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re beautiful.&#x201d; And I meant it.<br><br>By five I&#x2019;d finished for the day and I was eager to get back to my son. Leanne had taken Owen to the park. At nearly four my little man was a ball of explosive energy. I imagined my mother-in-law was more than ready for a break.<br><br>I got in my car and started the engine when my phone rang. I drove a ten-year-old Toyota while my soon-to-be ex-husband was in a nearly new BMW, a car I&#x2019;d bought him with the inheritance I&#x2019;d gotten after my parents died. That was another story entirely, and one I had to repeatedly push out of my mind. Rule number three: Let go in order to receive.<br><br>I frantically searched through my purse until I located my phone. Checking caller ID, I saw that it was Jake. No surprise. It seemed he found an excuse to call me just about every day. I was able to remain civil, but I resented his efforts to keep me tied to him. Friends had been all too eager to tell me he hadn&#x2019;t changed his womanizing ways. Now that I was out of the house my husband didn&#x2019;t bother to hide the fact he was a player.<br><br>This was supposed to have been his weekend with Owen, but he had a business trip. Or so he claimed. Because of what I knew, I&#x2019;d become suspicious of everything he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said, making sure I didn&#x2019;t sound overly friendly. It was difficult to maintain an emotional distance from him, especially when he worked overtime to make it hard. Jake knew all the right buttons to push with me. Through the negotiations for the divorce he&#x2019;d played me like a grand piano.<br><br>&#x201c;Hi, sweetheart.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You have the wrong number,&#x201d; I said forcefully. Every time he used an endearment I wondered how many other women he called &#x201c;sweetheart.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Come on, honey, there&#x2019;s no need to be bitter. I&#x2019;m calling with good news.&#x201d;<br><br>Sure he was. &#x201c;Which is?&#x201d;<br><br>He hesitated and his voice sank lower, laced with regret. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve signed off on the final negotiations. You want a share in the house, then fine, it&#x2019;s yours, but only when I choose to sell it. That&#x2019;s what you asked for, right?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right.&#x201d; Which meant this bitter struggle was over and the divorce could go through. Twenty-five months after I&#x2019;d filed we could sign the final papers.<br><br>&#x201c;You signed off?&#x201d; If that was the case I&#x2019;d be hearing from my attorney shortly, probably Monday morning.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s killing us both to drag this out any longer than it already has.&#x201d;<br><br>From the minute I&#x2019;d moved out of the house Jake had believed he could change my mind. I&#x2019;d gladly given up living in the house despite the fact that my attorney had advised me to stay put. All I asked for was my fair share of the proceeds when he chose to sell it.<br><br>I wasn&#x2019;t interested in living in that plush home any longer. My life there with all the expensive furnishings and designer details had been a sham. The memories were too much for me. Sleeping in our bed was torture, knowing Jake had defiled it. For all I knew he may even have made love to another woman in that very bed. Besides, holding on to the house would be a financial struggle. I needed to break away completely and start over. Jake had been surprised when I agreed to move out. I&#x2019;d used the house along with the country-club membership as bargaining chips in the settlement agreement.<br><br>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you going to say anything?&#x201d; Jake asked.<br><br>I wasn&#x2019;t sure what to say. &#x201c;I guess this is it, then,&#x201d; I whispered, staggering against a wall of emotion. My attorney assured me that eventually Jake would cave. It was either that or we would be headed to a meeting with a court-appointed negotiator. I was willing, but Jake had balked. Neither one of us wanted this to go to trial. The attorneys and the divorce proceedings were expensive enough.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah. It&#x2019;ll be final soon,&#x201d; Jake said, his voice so low it was almost a whisper. His words were filled with regret.<br><br>&#x201c;Final,&#x201d; I repeated, and bit into my lower lip.<br><br>&#x201c;You okay?&#x201d; Jake asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, of course.&#x201d; But I wasn&#x2019;t. After all this time one would think I&#x2019;d be glad this bickering and madness were about to end. I should be over the moon, eager to put my marriage behind me. I was more than ready to move on. Instead my heart felt like it was going to melt and a huge knot blocked my throat.<br><br>&#x201c;I thought you&#x2019;d want to know,&#x201d; Jake said, sounding as sad and miserable as I was.<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks. I&#x2019;ve got to go.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nichole . . . Nichole . . .&#x201d;<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t want to hear anything more that he had to say, so I ended the call. With tears blurring my eyes, I tossed my phone back inside my expensive Michael Kors purse. A purse I&#x2019;d purchased because Jake insisted I deserved beautiful things. Now I understood he&#x2019;d wanted me to have it because he&#x2019;d felt guilty. As best I could figure, I&#x2019;d bought the purse shortly after he learned Chrissy was pregnant with his child.<br><br>Wiping the moisture from my cheek, I put the car in reverse, stepped on the accelerator, and immediately backed into a ditch.<br><br>CHAPTER 2<br><br>Nichole<br><br>I don&#x2019;t know how long I sat in my car with my forehead resting against the steering wheel. I was embarrassed and shaken, and it wasn&#x2019;t only from the accident. My marriage was over. I thought I was ready, more than ready. The reality of it hit me full force; a deep sense of loss and unreality swamped my senses.<br><br>&#x201c;Nichole, are you all right?&#x201d;<br><br>A disembodied voice came at me. When I lifted my head I found Alicia, the hairstylist, standing alongside my upended car. When I didn&#x2019;t answer right away she knocked against the driver&#x2019;s-side window.<br><br>&#x201c;Nichole. Nichole.&#x201d;<br><br>I lifted my head and nodded. &#x201c;I am such an idiot.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Are you hurt?&#x201d;<br><br>I assured her I wasn&#x2019;t.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to need a tow truck to pull you out of here.&#x201d;<br><br>I figured as much.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you have Triple A?&#x201d;<br><br>I shook my head. It was an added expense I couldn&#x2019;t afford.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you want me to call someone for you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Please.&#x201d; Still I remained in the car, praying I hadn&#x2019;t done any further damage to my vehicle.<br><br>Alicia hesitated. &#x201c;Are you sure you&#x2019;re all right? You didn&#x2019;t hit your head or anything, did you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, no, I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d; I wasn&#x2019;t. I wasn&#x2019;t anywhere close to okay, but that wasn&#x2019;t due to the fact my car was head up in a ditch.<br><br>Alicia hesitated and then left me. Breathless, she returned a few minutes later. I remained seated in the car, clenching the steering wheel. She opened the driver&#x2019;s-side door. &#x201c;Potter Towing will be here within thirty minutes.&#x201d;<br><br>I nodded. &#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You need help getting out?&#x201d; She studied me as if unconvinced I hadn&#x2019;t suffered a head injury.<br><br>I sniffled, ran my hand beneath my nose, and shook my head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not hurt, just a little shook up.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Listen, I&#x2019;d wait with you, but I&#x2019;m giving Mrs. Fountaine a perm and I don&#x2019;t want to leave the solution on too long. Denise has gone for the day, so I&#x2019;m all alone.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry; go take care of Mrs. Fountaine. I&#x2019;ll be okay.&#x201d; I wanted to blame Jake for this but I was the one who hadn&#x2019;t looked where I was going.<br><br>Just as Alicia promised, a tow truck pulled into the parking lot about twenty-five minutes later. By then I had climbed out, had collected my purse, and was pacing anxiously, waiting. I&#x2019;d called Leanne and told her what happened.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re sure you&#x2019;re okay?&#x201d; Leanne asked, and I could hear the concern in her voice.<br><br>&#x201c;No, no, I&#x2019;m perfectly all right. I just wanted you to know I&#x2019;ll be later than usual. Look, I need to go, the tow truck just pulled up.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry about Owen. He&#x2019;s doing great. Take your time.&#x201d;<br><br>I disconnected just as a hulk of a man jumped out of the tow truck. He had on greasy overalls and a sleeveless shirt. Both arms revealed bulging muscles and full-sleeve tattoos. His eyes were a piercing shade of blue as his gaze skidded past me to my car.<br><br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;d that happen?&#x201d; he asked, studying the position of the car.<br><br>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t drinking, if that is what you think.&#x201d;<br><br>He shook his head and grinned. &#x201c;You mean to say you did that sober?&#x201d;<br><br>For the first time since I&#x2019;d ended the conversation with Jake, I smiled. &#x201c;I guess it does look like I was on something.&#x201d;<br><br>His smile was friendly, lighting up his eyes.<br><br>I wrapped my arms around my waist. &#x201c;How much is this going to set me back?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>He named a figure that caused me to swallow a gasp. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll need to put it on my credit card.&#x201d; I had one I used only for emergencies. I&#x2019;d once been free and easy with money. I could afford to be then, but no longer.<br><br>&#x201c;I can give you a discount for cash,&#x201d; he told me as he pulled out a thick wire cord and hooked it onto the car&#x2019;s bumper.<br><br>&#x201c;How much of a discount?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ten percent.&#x201d;<br><br>I did a quick calculation in my head. &#x201c;What about my debit card?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Still got to pay the bank fees with that. Cash only.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Will you take a check?&#x201d; I had a checkbook in my purse.<br><br>He paused and glanced over his shoulder. &#x201c;Is it good?&#x201d;<br><br>I was pissed that he&#x2019;d ask. &#x201c;Yes, it&#x2019;s good.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then I&#x2019;ll take your check.&#x201d;<br><br>Big of him.<br><br>&#x201c;I know Alicia,&#x201d; he said as he walked back to his truck. &#x201c;She said you work at that used-clothing place.&#x201d; He motioned with his head toward the shop.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a volunteer position, so it isn&#x2019;t like a job.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, that&#x2019;s what she said. She said it&#x2019;s a shop that dresses women looking for work. Guess you must have a good eye for that sort of thing.&#x201d;<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t expect an answer and I didn&#x2019;t give him one.<br><br>Once the car was connected to the tow truck, it took only a few minutes to bring it out of the ditch. He waited to make sure the engine started and I hadn&#x2019;t done any further damage.<br><br>I set my purse on the hood of the car and pulled out my checkbook. He took the check, folded it in half. He looked at me and then paused before slipping it into his pocket. It seemed like he had something he wanted to say. I waited and then realized he was probably worried about the check.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s good,&#x201d; I assured him again, annoyed that he seemed to think I&#x2019;d stiff him. Maybe he&#x2019;d gotten stiffed before.<br><br>&#x201c;Anything more I can do for you?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing. Thanks. I need to get home.&#x201d;<br><br>He gave me a salute and said, &#x201c;It was nice doing business with you, Ms. Patterson.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You, too, Mr. . . . ?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nyquist.

You pine for them at Mass, you miss their presence, and even wonder, How could life in Heaven be happy if the one I love is not present? When we feel this ache, the one intimately known to Saint Monica for years, we begin to learn how to love as God loves.</p><p>In this book, Maggie Green shows how you can faithfully follow the example of Saint Monica, whose prayers, tears, and witness eventually led to the conversion of both her husband and her son, Saint Augustine, Doctor of the Church. This isn't a book on how to win your prodigal child back it's a book on how to wait for them, how to be okay with planting the seeds and laboring in the vineyard without necessarily seeing the harvest.</p><p>Read these pages, and you'll come to see how the Holy Spirit is at work in each of us, calling us all home and encouraging our witness to each other. We're all part of the Saint Monica Club, praying and petitioning heaven until the day our loved ones return to the Faith and embrace the fullness of life that can only be found in Christ.</p></p><p>In the fourth century, a young man named Augustine turned his back on the Church, plunging into a frenzied life of lust and dissipation. His renunciation left Monica, his pious Catholic mother, weeping and praying for his salvation . . . for more than a decade! <p> Like so many Catholics today -- even perhaps like you -- Monica wrestled daily with the pain of having a loved one fall away from the Faith. Like us, she often feared that her prayers and tears were of little worth, empty, futile. </p><p> Not so! After nearly two decades, Augustine returned to the Faith, and in a big way. Revered today as Saint Augustine, he joined in holiness his mother, Monica -- now Saint Monica -- whose sacrifices, prayers, and pain finally won for both of them the crown of sanctity. </p><p> In these pages, author Maggie Green provides wise, compassionate guidance for members of what she calls "The Saint Monica Club": good Catholics suffering like Monica the rejection of the Faith by persons they love dearly. </p><p> Herself a longtime and long-suffering member of the club, Green shows how persevering as Monica did in devoted love for straying souls -- loving them as God does -- will not only quiet the lingering, aching cry of our hearts, but will also draw our lost loved ones back to the Faith and into the arms of Jesus again. Yes, the non-confrontational Way of Saint Monica is hard. But it is the only way. These pages demonstrate that, with the souls of our loved ones at stake, it is worth the effort. . .and worth the wait.</p>Maggie Green is a pen name for a Catholic wife and mother who waits for some of her children to return to the Faith.

In an era of dirigibles and hot air balloons, the Wright Brothers were among the first innovators of heavier than air flight. But in the hotly competitive international race toward flight, Orville and Wilbur were up against a lot more than bad weather. Mechanical failures, lack of information, and even other aviators complicated the Wright Brothers&#x2019; journey. Though they weren&#x2019;t as wealthy as their European counterparts, their impressive achievements demanded attention on the international stage. Thanks to their carefully recorded experiments and a healthy dash of bravery, the Wright Brothers&#x2019; flying machines took off.</p></p><p><p><b>Alison Wilgus</b> is a Brooklyn-based author of comics and prose.

Serving as narrator, interviewer, and cheerleader, Orville and Wilbur's younger sister Katharine squires readers from her brothers' childhood encounter with a small rubber band powered "h�licopt�re" invented by Alphonse P�naud through their final triumph, then swoops through a quick history of later aviation, with particular attention to Englishman Frank Whittle's work on turbojets in World War II. She pauses at appropriate points to survey contemporaneous aeronautical progress in France and elsewhere. She also delivers lucid explanations of Newton's laws of motion, aerodynamics, and other significant scientific principles, as well as full, exact specs for each of the Wrights' gliders and powered aircraft.

They live in North Carolina.<b>Introduction:</b><br><br>In 1776, fifty-six&nbsp;men risked their lives to defy the British&nbsp;and sign their names to the Declaration of Independence, but&nbsp;most Americans can&#x2019;t name more than a handful.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There&#x2019;s John Hancock, of course. And most people will correctly&nbsp;identify Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and John&nbsp;Adams. But then the guessing begins: George Washington? Paul&nbsp;Revere? Thomas Paine?<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Declaration of Independence is America&#x2019;s birth certificate,&nbsp;its most celebrated document, and a model for later declarations&nbsp;crafted by struggling peoples the world over. Its signers were men<br> who drew upon the best within themselves in the face of horrifyingly&nbsp;difficult circumstances.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They also lived remarkably interesting lives. True, most of&nbsp;them were privileged members of the elite upper classes, but quite&nbsp;a few were just the opposite. And all these men were impacted by&nbsp;death, suffering, and adversity. Many were orphaned; even more&nbsp;lost children and wives for no other reason than that, in those&nbsp;days, the flu was deadly. So was asthma. So was a bad bout of&nbsp;diarrhea. Yet all these men carried on.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Over the years, we&#x2019;ve read newspaper articles and junk e-mails&nbsp;seeking to quantify and magnify the sufferings of the signers.&nbsp;Every July, their miseries are dusted off and trotted out along&nbsp;with barbecues and flags. It&#x2019;s a shame that this is the only time of&nbsp;year Americans think about these men. But it&#x2019;s even more&nbsp;disheartening to discover that most of the stories are just plain&nbsp;false.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the end, it doesn&#x2019;t matter that none of the signers were killed&nbsp;for affixing their name to the Declaration of Independence or that&nbsp;none died in battle. What does matter is that they came together&nbsp;one sweltering summer under distressing circumstances and,&nbsp;despite huge differences in opinion, backgrounds, and values,&nbsp;decided to band together and form a new nation. Doing so was,&nbsp;without a doubt, an enormous, life-threatening&nbsp;risk, and if the&nbsp;colonies had not been triumphan&#x2014;and honestly, it&#x2019;s astounding&nbsp;that they were&#x2014;these men would have surely been, as they used&nbsp;to say back in the day, fitted with a &#x201c;halter.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the Declaration of Independence so eloquently states in its&nbsp;last line, they risked their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred&nbsp;honor.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We think they are worth knowing.<br><br><b>A Clarification: The Real Independence Day</b><br><br>Happy Fourth of July! Wait, scratch that. We mean:&nbsp;Happy Second of July! Hold on, that&#x2019;s still not right: Happy Second&nbsp;of August!<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;John Adams thought that future generations of Americans&nbsp;should celebrate Independence Day &#x201c;with Pomp and Parade, with&nbsp;Shows, Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations&nbsp;from one End of this Continent to the other from this Time forward&nbsp;forever more.&#x201d; Adams omitted the burgers, hot dogs, and&nbsp;beer kegs, but his heart was in the right place. Oddly, when he&nbsp;wrote these words to his wife, Abigail, on July 3, 1776, he wasn&#x2019;t&nbsp;talking about the Fourth of July. He was speaking of what he considered&nbsp;to be the nation&#x2019;s true birthday: July 2, 1776.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The events leading up to that date were as follows: On June 7,&nbsp;1776, Richard Henry Lee of Virginia proposed that the colonies&nbsp;break with England. Though the citizenry had debated this point&nbsp;for years, the thought of finally doing the deed shook the delegates.&nbsp;To calm themselves, they did what any political body would&nbsp;do: they postponed the vote for a month. During that time, a&nbsp;committee of five congressmen&#x2014;Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin&nbsp;Franklin, John Adams, Robert R. Livingston, and Roger Sherman&#x2014;was appointed to write the Declaration of Independence.&nbsp;Jefferson ended up doing most of the heavy lifting, with some&nbsp;editorial suggestions from Adams and Franklin.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tensions were running high by July 1, the day of an &#x201c;unofficial&#x201d;&nbsp;vote. Only nine colonies supported the break. South Carolina&nbsp;and Pennsylvania voted no, Delaware was deadlocked, and New&nbsp;York abstained. But when the official vote came on July 2, twelve&nbsp;of the thirteen colonies voted in favor. New York abstained again;&nbsp;they were waiting for permission that was held up in Ye Olde Trafficke&nbsp;but promised they would likely vote yea in a few days. It&nbsp;wasn&#x2019;t exactly unanimous, but Congress went with it anyway. The&nbsp;motion carried. A new nation was born.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For the next two days, Congress polished the language of the&nbsp;Declaration, and the document was officially adopted on July 4.&nbsp;But only two men&#x2014;President of Congress John Hancock and his&nbsp;secretary, Charles Thomson&#x2014;actually signed the document on&nbsp;that day. Shortly after, a local printer named John Dunlap set the&nbsp;words into type, and about 200 copies were distributed throughout&nbsp;the new thirteen states. When Americans saw the July 4 date&nbsp;emblazoned at the top of Dunlap&#x2019;s broadside, they mistook the&nbsp;date of adoption for the day of the momentous vote. In fact, it&nbsp;wasn&#x2019;t until August 2, 1776, that the majority of the signers affixed&nbsp;their signatures to a fancier version of the &#x201c;unanimous&#x201d; Declaration&#x2014;the one displayed today at the National Archives in&nbsp;Washington, D.C.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By August 1776, thousands of colonists were already regarding&nbsp;July 4 as the most important date in their fledgling nation&#x2019;s history.&nbsp;To avoid upsetting this pleasant fiction, Congress sneakily&nbsp;backdated some official records to show that all fifty-six&nbsp;men had&nbsp;signed on July 4, 1776. Of course, this introduced a bizarre anachronism&nbsp;into the final record: the men who were present in&nbsp;Philadelphia and who voted for independence on July 2 were not&nbsp;the same group of men who signed on August 2! By the time&nbsp;August 2 rolled around, some of the original voters were out of&nbsp;town, fighting in the war, helping their states write new constitutions&#x2014;or they had been replaced by entirely new delegates.&nbsp;Moreover, not all the delegates could make it to the big affair on&nbsp;August 2, and so they signed when they could get around to it&#x2014;one as late as 1781.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But that doesn&#x2019;t make for a tidy story, does it? No wonder&nbsp;Americans have wished one another a Happy Fourth of July ever&nbsp;since.</p><h2>The Midnight Star (The Young Elites)</h2><p><p><b>The thrilling finale to the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling Young Elites series from &#x201c;hit factory&#x201d; Marie Lu<br><br>#1&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author Marie Lu concludes Adelina's story with this haunting and hypnotizing final installment to the Young Elites series.<br></b><br>Adelina Amouteru is done suffering.

He is no longer tending to the prince&#x2019;s wounds but standing, waiting, frightened in his bedchamber at the Fortunata Court years ago, looking out at a sea of masked people.<br> &nbsp;<br> It seemed as if the entire city had turned out for Raffaele&#x2019;s debut. Noblemen and noblewomen, their robes of Tamouran silks and Kenettran lace, fanned out across the room, their faces all partially hidden behind colorful half masks, their laughter mingling with the sounds of clinking glass and shuffling slip�pers. Other consorts moved amongst them, silent and grace�ful, serving drinks and dishes of iced grapes.<br> &nbsp;<br> Raffaele stood in the center of the room, a demure youth dressed and groomed to the height of perfection, his hair a curtain of dark satin, his gold-and-white robes flowing, black powder lining the rims of his jewel-toned eyes, staring out at a sea of curious bidders. He remembers how his hands trem�bled, how he&#x2019;d pressed one against the other to steady them. He had been trained in the types of expressions to allow on his face, a thousand different subtleties of the lips and brows and cheeks and eyes, regardless of whether they reflected his actual emotions. So, in this moment, his expression had been one of serene calm, of shy allure and gentle joy, silent as snow, absent of his fear.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now and then, the energy seemed to shift in the room. Raffaele turned his head mechanically in its direction, un�sure of what he was sensing. He thought at first that perhaps his mind was playing tricks on him&#x2014;until he realized that the energy focused on a young stranger gliding between the crowds. Raffaele&#x2019;s eyes followed him, mesmerized by the power that seemed to travel in his wake.<br> &nbsp;<br> The bidding started high and spiraled higher. It soared until Raffaele could no longer make out the numbers, the sights and sounds around him beginning to blur. Other consorts whispered to one another in the audience. He had never heard such amounts tossed back and forth at an auction before, and the strangeness of it all made his heart pound faster, his hands shake harder. At this rate, he could never live up to the winner&#x2019;s payment.<br> &nbsp;<br> And then, as the bidding began to trickle down to a few&#x2014;a young manservant hidden in the crowd doubled the highest offer.<br> &nbsp;<br> Raffaele&#x2019;s calm expression wavered for the first time as murmurs rippled through the room. The madam called again for an offer to top it, but none did. Raffaele stood in the silence, willing himself to remain still as the manservant won the auction.<br> &nbsp;<br> That evening, Raffaele lit a few candles with unsteady hands and then sat alone on the edge of his bed. The blan�kets were silken, trimmed with gold thread and lace, and the scent of night lilies lingered in the air. The minutes dragged on. He listened for the sound of footsteps approaching his chambers and repeated to himself lessons that older consorts had given him over the years.<br> &nbsp;<br> After what seemed like an eternity, he heard the sound he had been waiting for in the hall outside. Moments later, there was a soft knock on the door.<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>It will be all right, </i>Raffaele whispered, unsure of the truth of these words. He got up and raised his voice. &#x201c;Come in, please.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> A maid pushed the door open. Behind her, a masked young man walked into his chambers with the grace of a seasoned predator. The door closed behind him, right as he reached up to remove the mask from his face.<br> &nbsp;<br> Raffaele&#x2019;s eyes widened in surprise. This was the same stranger he&#x2019;d noticed in the crowd. He realized, embar�rassed, that the stranger was quite handsome&#x2014;dark curls of hair tied back into a low tail, long black lashes framing his eyes, scarlet slashes in his irises. He stood tall, and he did not smile. The energy Raffaele had sensed during the bidding now enveloped the stranger in layers. <i>Fire. Flames. Ambition. </i>Raffaele flushed. He knew he should be inviting the stranger to come closer, to sit on the bed. But, in this moment, he couldn&#x2019;t think.<br> &nbsp;<br> The young man stepped forward. When he stopped before Raffaele, he folded his hands behind his back and nodded once. Raffaele felt the energy shift again, beckoning at him, and he couldn&#x2019;t help but return the stranger&#x2019;s gaze. Raffaele forced himself to give the young man a smile, one he had been trained to give for years.<br> &nbsp;<br> The stranger spoke first. &#x201c;You noticed me in the crowd,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I saw your eyes following me around the room. Why is that?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I suppose I was drawn to you,&#x201d; Raffaele replied, turning his eyes down and letting the heat rise to his cheeks again. &#x201c;What is your name, sir?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Enzo Valenciano.&#x201d; The stranger&#x2019;s voice was soft and deep, silk hiding steel.<br> &nbsp;<br> Raffaele&#x2019;s eyes shot back up to him. <i>Enzo Valenciano. </i>Was that not the name of the disgraced prince of Kenettra? Only now, in the dim light of the chamber, did Raffaele realize that the boy&#x2019;s hair glinted with a hint of deep red, so deep it looked black. A marking.<br> &nbsp;<br> The former crown prince.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Your Highness?&#x201d; Raffaele whispered, so startled that he didn&#x2019;t think to bow again.<br> &nbsp;<br> The young man nodded. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;m afraid I have no inten�tion of fulfilling your debut night.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The scene evaporates as a knock sounds on the door. Raffaele and Enzo look over at it in unison and Raffaele lets out a long breath, pushing the memory to the back of his mind as he puts down the bandages. &#x201c;Yes?&#x201d; he calls out.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Raffaele?&#x201d; a timid voice answers. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He folds his hands into his sleeves. &#x201c;Come in.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The door opens, and Violetta steps hesitantly inside. Her eyes first meet Raffaele&#x2019;s, then dart to where Enzo sits with his elbows leaning against his knees. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry to interrupt,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Raffaele, something strange is happening down by the shore. I thought you might want to have a look.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Raffaele listens with a frown. So, Violetta has sensed something ominous as well. She looks pale tonight, her olive skin ashen, her full lips pulled into a tight line, hair secured behind a Tamouran wrap. She had found the Daggers with her power almost a year ago, all on her own. It&#x2019;d taken her a week to find the words to tell Raffaele what had happened between her and her sister, then another week still before she begged them through her tears to find a way to help Adelina. Since then, she has stayed at Raffaele&#x2019;s side, working with him as he tested her alignments and taught her how to con�centrate her ability to sense others&#x2019; energy. She was a good student. A <i>fantastic </i>student.<br> &nbsp;<br> She reminds him so much of Adelina. If he let himself, Raffaele could imagine that he was staring at a younger version of the Queen of the Sealands, before she turned her back. Before she was beyond help. The thought always saddened him. <i>It is my fault, what Adelina has become. My fault that it is too late.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Raffaele nods at Violetta. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll come in a moment. Wait for me outside.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> As Violetta retreats to the hallway, he finishes bandaging Enzo&#x2019;s arms, then rubs his own neck in exhaustion. Too many nights in a row he&#x2019;s spent like this, weeks that stretched into months, all trying in vain to repair Enzo&#x2019;s wounds. But every time they began to heal, they would worsen again. &#x201c;Try to sleep,&#x201d; Raffaele tells him.<br> &nbsp;<br> Enzo doesn&#x2019;t respond. His face is drawn, pale from the pain. He is both here and not.<br> &nbsp;<br> How long ago was it that they had first lost him in the arena? Two years? It seems a lifetime ago, eons, since the last time Raffaele had seen his prince truly alive, the fire in him burning bright and scarlet. He does not want to give Enzo more reason to suffer right now, to let him know how much his presence&#x2014;half in the living realm, half in the Under�world&#x2014;hurts those who love him. Instead, Raffaele walks to the door and quietly lets himself out.<br> &nbsp;<br> The night is warm, a prelude to Sunland summers, and the heat from the day still lingers in the corridors. Raffaele and Violetta walk in silence under the lanterns, passing through the light and the shadows. At each door, he can sense the energy of every one of his Daggers staying inside the apartments. Michel, who after Gemma&#x2019;s death has locked him�self away for days at a time, losing himself in his paintings. Lucent, whose chamber has a ripple of disturbance in it. Raffaele can sense that she is still awake, perhaps gaz�ing out of her bedchamber window down at the shores. Lucent&#x2019;s bones have continued to hollow, and now she aches constantly, a development that has made her bitter and short-tempered. Maeve had stayed at first, begging Lucent to return to Beldain with her, even tried bribing and com�manding her&#x2014;but Lucent had refused. She would remain with the Daggers and fight alongside them until her dying breath. After a while, Maeve was forced to lead her soldiers home. But the Beldish queen&#x2019;s letters still arrive weekly, ask�ing about Lucent&#x2019;s health, sometimes sending along herbs and medicines. Nothing has helped. Raffaele knows it will <i>never </i>help, for Lucent&#x2019;s illness is caused by something deep within her own energy.<br> &nbsp;<br> The last chamber once belonged to Leo, the bald boy whom Raffaele had recently recruited to the Daggers, who had wielded the power to poison. Now the chamber sits empty. Leo died a month earlier. The doctor told Raffaele that it was because of a lingering lung infection. But Raffaele wonders about another possible reason&#x2014;because Leo&#x2019;s body had turned on itself, poisoning him from within. <br> &nbsp;<br> What weakness will soon manifest in him? <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I heard about Adelina&#x2019;s latest conquest,&#x201d; Violetta says when they finally reach the stairway leading out of the palace. <br> &nbsp;<br> Raffaele only nods. <br> &nbsp;<br> Violetta glances at him furtively. &#x201c;Do you think . . . ?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> How hard she tries. Raffaele can feel his heart reaching out to her, wishing to comfort her, but all he can do is take her hand and soothe her temporarily with a tug of her heart�strings. He shakes his head. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But&#x2014;I hear she is offering generous payments to the cit�izens of Dumor,&#x201d; Violetta replies. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s been more generous than she could be. Perhaps if we could only find a way to&#x2014;&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;She is beyond help,&#x201d; Raffaele says softly. An answer he has given many times. He is not certain that he believes it, not entirely, but he cannot bear to raise Violetta&#x2019;s hopes only to see them crushed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. We need to concentrate on defending Tamoura against Adelina&#x2019;s next move. We must make a stand somewhere.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Violetta looks back toward the shoreline and nods. &#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; she says, as if convincing herself. <br> &nbsp;<br> She is not like the others. She aligns with gems, of course&#x2014; with fear, empathy, and joy&#x2014;but she has no markings to speak of. Her ability to take away others&#x2019; powers makes him uneasy. And yet, Raffaele cannot help feeling a bond with her, a comfort in knowing that she, too, can <i>feel </i>the world around her. <br> &nbsp;<br> None of the three moons nor any stars are visible tonight; only clouds blanket the sky. Raffaele offers Violetta his arm as they pick their way carefully down the stony path. A hint of charge lingers in the warm winds, prickling his skin. As they make their way around the edge of the estate, the shore comes into view, a line of white foam crashing into black space. <br> &nbsp;<br> Now he senses what had troubled Violetta. Right along the shore where the sand turns cold and wet, the feeling is incredibly strong, as if all the strings in the world were pulled tight. The waves spray him with flecks of salt water. The night is so dark that they cannot make out any other de�tails around them. Large, looming masses of rock lie nearby, nothing more than black silhouettes. Raffaele stares at them, feeling a sense of dread. There is a pungent scent in the air. <br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Something is wrong. </i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There is death here,&#x201d; Violetta whispers, her hand quiver�ing against Raffaele&#x2019;s arm. When he looks at her, he notices that her eyes seem haunted, the same look she has whenever she talks about Adelina. <br> &nbsp;<br> Raffaele scans the horizon. Yes, something is very wrong, an unnatural energy permeating the air. There is so much of it, he cannot tell where it is coming from. His eyes settle on a dark patch far in the distance. He stares at it for a while. <br> &nbsp;<br> A series of lightning streaks breaks through the sky, carv�ing trails from the clouds to the sea. Violetta flinches, waiting for the thunderclap to follow, but there is none, and the si�lence raises the hairs on the back of Raffaele&#x2019;s neck. Finally, after an eternity, a low rumble shakes the ground. His eyes travel down to the waves crashing along the shore, then stop again on the black silhouettes of rock. <br> &nbsp;<br> The lightning flashes again. This time, the glow lights up the shore for a brief moment. Raffaele steps backward, tak�ing in the sight. <br> &nbsp;<br> The black silhouettes are not rocks at all. They are baliras, at least a dozen of them, beached and dead. <br> &nbsp;<br> Violetta&#x2019;s hands fly to her mouth. For a moment, all Raffaele can do is stay where he is. Many sailors told sto�ries about where baliras went when they died&#x2014;some said they would go far out into the open ocean, where they would swim lower and lower until they sank to the depths of the Underworld. Others said they would leap out of the water and fly higher and higher, until they were swallowed up by the clouds. The occasional rib bone washed ashore, bleached white. But never had he seen a dead balira in the flesh before. Certainly not like this. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t come closer,&#x201d; Raffaele whispers to Violetta. The smell in the air grows more pungent as he draws near, now unmistakably the smell of rotting flesh. As he reaches the first balira, he extends a hand out toward it. He hesitates, then places his fingers gently against its body. <br> &nbsp;<br> The beast twitches once. This one is just an infant, and it is not dead yet. <br> &nbsp;<br> Raffaele&#x2019;s throat tightens, and tears fill his eyes. Something terrible killed these creatures. He can still feel the poisonous energy coursing through its veins, can sense its weakness as it takes another low, rasping gasp of air. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Raffaele,&#x201d; Violetta calls out. When he looks over his shoul�der, he sees her wading into the waves as they break against the beach. The hem of her dress is soaked, and she is quaking like a leaf. <i>Get out of there, </i>Raffaele wants to warn her. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This feels like Adelina&#x2019;s energy,&#x201d; Violetta finally says. <br> &nbsp;<br> Raffaele takes a hesitant step toward the ocean, then an�other. He walks forward until his slippers sink into wet sand. He sucks his breath in sharply. <br> &nbsp;<br> The water is cold in a way that he has never felt before, cold like <i>death</i>. A thousand threads of energy tug at his feet as the water recedes, as if each one were barbed with tiny hooks, seeking a living being. It sends his skin crawling in the same way a rotting...</p><h2>Phonics, Phonemic Awareness, and Word Analysis for Teachers: An Interactive Tutorial (What&#39;s New in Literacy)</h2><p><p>A classic in the field, this practical, self-paced tutorial allows readers to independently study and learn the important aspects of phonics, phonemic awareness, and word analysis they need to know in order to succeed on teacher certification or competency tests.

Say hello at&nbsp;letsfindmomo.com.<b>Introduction<br></b>At the beginning of 2018, my dog Momo and I left Canadian soil to explore 22 countries in&nbsp;Europe. We landed in Portugal with enough dog food to last a few weeks, a room to stay in for a&nbsp;few nights, and a loose plan to have a few adventures. What happened afterward is shown in the&nbsp;pages of this book.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Aside from your dog, there are two things you definitely should bring on any trip: the means&nbsp;and the will. Although the means is necessary&#x2014;to afford accommodations, food, transportation&#x2014;the more important of the two is, in fact, the will. For me, the means fell into place long&nbsp;after the will took hold. Only when we were already on European soil did I buy an old camper,&nbsp;which gave us a place to sleep, a kitchen to cook in, and the best transportation for a road trip&nbsp;with a dog.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In Albania, I walked the deserted winter beaches of a tiny tourist town along the Adriatic&nbsp;Coast. Momo was barking as he romped through the water, demanding I throw something,&nbsp;anything, for him to fetch. I didn&#x2019;t have his ball, so I dug around the littered tide and found a&nbsp;twig. I broke it into smaller bits and tossed them a few feet, one by one. Momo leaped from the&nbsp;water for each tiny twig with more vigor than the last.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;See, the will to go on a journey doesn&#x2019;t need to be a life purpose or a grand plan (though it&nbsp;could be either of those things). The will can be almost imperceptible at first. It might start with&nbsp;an idea, a person to visit, a twig to chase . . . or it could be as simple as changing &#x201c;I <i>think</i> I&#x2019;m going&nbsp;to Europe&#x201d; to &#x201c;I&#x2019;m <i>going</i> to Europe.&#x201d; This last example was my catalyst, and though it took me a&nbsp;few years to say it, the wheels started turning once I did.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With Momo always a few steps ahead of me, we met wild apes in Gibraltar, dipped into the&nbsp;Mediterranean&#x2019;s blue waters, scaled mountains with my dad on the Isle of Skye, watched the sun&nbsp;rise at the foot of the Eiffel Tower, and met countless amazing people who helped us along our&nbsp;mostly solo journey.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But it all started that first day in Portugal, after Momo&#x2019;s first-ever airplane flight, a lot of&nbsp;paperwork, and a long pee on a pole at the airport taxi stand (by Momo).

She lives in Southern California.</p><br><br>&nbsp;<b>Ronald Himler</b> is the award-winning illustrator of more than 75 books for children. He lives in the desert outside of Tuscon, Arizona and can be visited online at ronhimler.com<br> &nbsp;Francisco, trying to find work for his grandfather, or abuelo, who has just arrived from Mexico, acts as a liaison between Abuelo, who doesn't speak English, and Ben, who wants to hire a gardener for a day's work. Eager to earn the badly needed pay, Francisco assures Ben that his grandfather is a skilled gardener (Abuelo is in fact a carpenter). Returning at the end of the day, Ben is shocked to discover that Francisco and Abuelo stripped his field of the plants and left the weeds. Abuelo is also angered, learning only now that Francisco had lied to Ben, and refuses payment until they have done the job correctly. Recognizing the older man's integrity, Ben rewards Abuelo and Francisco with the promise of "more than just one day's work." Says Ben of the plants: "The roots are still there. If they've replanted early, they'll be alright." Similarly, Francisco is given a chance to start over. He changes from a naively parental figure to a child who "had begun to learn the important things." The shift in the boy's role quietly suggests not only the importance of a work ethic but also Francisco's need to be a child, guided by a caring adult. With expressive, gestural watercolors, Himler, who illustrated Bunting's Fly Away Home and Someday a Tree, conveys the boy's complex relationship with his grandfather and strongly invokes both the harsh and the tender landscapes of Francisco's world.

Some of the stories and histories I stumbled across were almost too intense and gruesome to be believed.</p> <p><strong>I. Norwich State Hospital for the Insane</strong> </p> <p>Preston, Connecticut 1904 &#x2015; 1996</p> <p>When most people think of an asylum, they probably picture a giant looming mansion that looks something like Norwich State Hospital for the Insane. It has one of those iconic, red brick exteriors with columns and a steep roof. The hospital is also notable for its maze of underground passageways. It&#x2019;s considered by creep and ghost aficionados to be extremely haunted. Several shows have featured the hospital, including the popular series <i>Ghost Hunters</i>.</p> <p><strong>II. Whittingham Asylum</strong> </p> <p>Lancashire, England 1869 &#x2015; 1995</p> <p>Whittingham Asylum, charming and even quaint on the outside, makes the list if only for its sheer size. Whittingham was virtually a miniature city, and its expansive grounds included a brewery, post office, and even its own brass band. It was also the sight of some seriously scary allegations, with an inquiry in the 1960s that included reports of cruelty and fraud, complaints that were kept quiet with threats. Reportedly, some wards were infested with vermin, while others were left freezing cold. There were even rumors of a &#x201c;wet towel treatment&#x201d; involving a cold, wet towel wrapped around the patient&#x2019;s neck until they passed out.</p> <p><strong>III. Waverly Hills Sanatorium</strong> </p> <p>Louisville, Kentucky 1910 &#x2015; 1962</p> <p>The architecturally stunning Waverly Hills was built to house a sudden influx of tuberculosis patients in the county, but closed after only fifty years when medical advances rendered the facility obsolete. Considered to be one of the most haunted hospitals in the eastern United States, it has played host to scores of reality TV shows about the paranormal, including <i>Scariest Places on Earth</i> and <i>Ghost Hunters</i>. It gets creepier&#x2015;there are currently plans to renovate the hospital into a hotel for those looking to have a spooky spot to stay.</p> <p><strong>IV. Lier Mental Hospital</strong> </p> <p>Buskerud County, Norway 1926 &#x2015; 1986</p> <p>Perhaps the scariest thing about Lier Mental Hospital is its murky involvement in experimentation linked to pharmaceutical companies from the United States. This postwar hospital was used for experimentation and research into lobotomies, LSD, electroshock therapy and more.</p> <p><strong>V. Topeka State Hospital</strong> </p> <p>Topeka, Kansas 1872 &#x2015; 1997</p> <p>Topeka State Hospital may look cute and charming on the outside, but on the inside it was home to some unbelievably dark rumors. By far the creepiest allegations leveled against the hospital? (Brace yourself, it&#x2019;s pretty gross.) There are stories of patients strapped down for so long that their skin began to grow <i>around</i> the straps. Yeesh. Nowadays, you can sometimes hear music playing from inside the abandoned hospital and spot shadows peering out at the windows.</p> <p><b>Heather Brewer Interviews Madeleine Roux</b></p> <p><strong>HB: </strong>The imagery was so vivid in ASYLUM and the photographs throughout were just gorgeous&#x2015;was it based on anywhere you&#x2019;ve visited personally?</p> <p><strong>MR: </strong>The admittedly limited travel I&#x2019;ve done in Europe included some incredible ruins and castles. There&#x2019;s a feeling you get in those places, a sort of wonder and terror that you just don&#x2019;t feel in new buildings. I tried to draw on those memories for Brookline. I also grew up in an old Victorian farmhouse, and . . . I don&#x2019;t want to say it&#x2019;s haunted but there were certainly times it felt haunted. To this day, when I visit my parents, I feel eyes on me at night in the hallway. The hairs on the back of your neck go up and you can sense there&#x2019;s history there present with you. I wanted that same feeling to come through with Brookline.</p> <p><strong>HB: </strong>I felt really connected to Dan Crawford, your main character. What part of your fabulous mind did he come from?</p> <p><strong>MR: </strong>I was kind of a weird kid. I loved school. I wasn&#x2019;t so much a loner as a gigantic nerd, always with my nose in a book or writing my own scripts and stories. There&#x2019;s a good bit of my own insecurities and childhood memories in Dan; that same geek pride mixed with a constant fear that maybe life would be easier if I veered more toward the mainstream. Writing a male perspective is intimidating in the sense that I wanted it to feel authentic, so I would stop every once in a while and ask a friend if it was reading correctly to them. Having honest buddies helped, it always does for writing. They weren&#x2019;t shy about saying, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry but no guy would do/think/act that way, try again.&#x201d;</p> <p><strong>HB: </strong>Has horror always appealed to you? If not, why now, why this story? If so . . . well . . . same question.</p> <p><strong>MR: </strong>The first two novels I did had a certain creep factor, too, since they were about zombies and survival. The irony here is that I&#x2019;m a huge wuss when it comes to scary movies. I spent most of <i>Cabin In the Woods</i> whimpering in someone else&#x2019;s lap. I&#x2019;m not good with scary movies or gore or anything like that, but I find myself drawn to that kind of story again and again. It&#x2019;s like I know it&#x2019;s going to keep me up all night but I can&#x2019;t help myself. I think that&#x2019;s probably common, though . . . . We all test ourselves now and again, see where our boundaries and limits are. I get a kick out of pushing those limits for myself and exploring the darker parts of my imagination. My life isn&#x2019;t all that adventurous, so writing darker stories gives me a chance to indulge in the more morbid thoughts that cross my mind.</p> <p><strong>HB: </strong>I know you probably get asked this a lot, but what&#x2019;s your favorite piece of writing advice for the writers out there?</p> <p><strong>MR: </strong>It comes from Neil Gaiman and is infuriatingly straightforward and simple. &#x201c;How do you do it? You do it. You write. You finish what you write.&#x201d; And it&#x2019;s true. As I&#x2019;m sure you know, there&#x2019;s no magic button. Sometimes you can&#x2019;t write a sentence and other times you can&#x2019;t stop, but just sitting down and making yourself do it is the key. You have to practice. You have to do the work, over and over. He also has another great piece of advice somewhere (I&#x2019;m an unabashed Neil fangirl, I can&#x2019;t help it) about getting out and living life, and not feeling upset or pressured if you don&#x2019;t have a huge well of experience to draw on. The best inspiration comes from falling in love, falling out of it, getting your heart broken, just being present and showing up, you know? You won&#x2019;t have anything to draw from if you guard yourself too closely. You have to risk life changing you in order to have something there to write about.</p> <p><strong>HB: </strong>What&#x2019;s next from the shadowed mind of Madeleine Roux? What are you working on, and when can I have it? :)</p> <p><strong>MR: </strong>I&#x2019;m notorious for starting new projects and then abandoning them, but I&#x2019;ve had a gritty YA fantasy series cooking in my head for a while now. I&#x2019;ve been taking down tons of notes for it and I&#x2019;ve even started a few chapters, so right now I hope that has wings and takes off.

Street gangs rule the day while fear and superstition rule the night. When warrior angels fly away with a helpless little girl, her seventeen-year-old sister Penryn will do anything to get her back. Anything, including making a deal with Raffe, an injured enemy angel. Traveling through a dark and twisted Northern California, they journey toward the angels&#x2019; stronghold in San Francisco, where Penryn will risk everything to rescue her sister and Raffe will put himself at the mercy of his greatest enemies for the chance to be made whole again.</p><p>Susan Ee has eaten mezze in the old city of Jerusalem, surfed the warm waters of Costa Rica, and played her short film at a major festival. She has a life-long love of science fiction, fantasy and horror, especially if there&#39;s a touch of romance. She used to be a lawyer but loves being a writer because it allows her souped-up imagination to bust out and go feral.In Ee&#x2019;s gritty debut, which stars a heroine with backbone, angels of the apocalypse seek revenge against humans for killing the Archangel Gabriel, and street gangs have taken over Silicon Valley. Seventeen-year-old Penryn lives with (and cares for) her wheelchair-bound sister, Paige, and their paranoid schizophrenic mother. While attempting to escape their apartment to find safety, Paige is kidnapped by an angel. At the moment of the abduction, Penryn meets Raffe, an angel whose wings have been cut off by the angels who take Paige. Hoping Raffe might know where Paige is, Penryn reluctantly nurses him back to health, and the two join forces, traveling to the angels&#x2019; &#x201c;aerie&#x201d; in San Francisco to recover Paige and repair Raffe&#x2019;s wings; along the way, they are captured by a dangerously anarchic army of the human resistance. Smartly conceived details (for example, there&#x2019;s a bounty on angel body parts, turning them into a commodity) feel fresh in this apocalyptic romance that&#x2019;s sustained by well-developed characters, atmosphere, and strong writing. Ee leaves plenty to discover in a planned sequel. <em>Ages 14&#x2013;up.

As she walks among the dead, an elderly man appears--the same soldier she met that fateful day long ago. Today, he asks if the cemetery has room for one more.<br><br>Based on an extraordinary true story, this brilliant, meticulously researched novel flashes back to 1864 and the afternoon of the Civil War. While the fierce fighting rages on Carrie's land, her plantation turns into a Confederate army hospital; four generals lie dead on her back porch; the pile of amputated limbs rises as tall as the smoke house. But when a wounded soldier named Zachariah Cashwell arrives at her house, he awakens feelings she had thought long dead--and inspires a passion as powerful and unforgettable as the war that consumes a nation.<br><br><i>*Includes reading group guide*</i><br></p><p>In an Author's Note at the end of his book <i>The Widow of the South</i>, Robert Hicks tells us that "when Oscar Wilde made his infamous tour of America in 1882, he told his hosts that his itinerary should include a visit to 'sunny Tennessee to meet the Widow McGavock, the high priestess of the temple of dead boys.'" Carrie McGavock, The Widow of the South, did indeed take it upon herself to grieve the loss of so many young men in the battle of Franklin, Tennessee, which took place on November 30, 1864. Nine thousand men lost their lives that day. She and her husband John eventually re-buried on their own land 1,481 Confederate soldiers killed at Franklin, when the family that owned the land on which the original shallow graves had been dug decided to plow it under and put it into cultivation.<p> Before the battle begins, Carrie's house is commandeered for a field hospital and all normal life is suspended. Carrie is anything but normal, however. She has buried three children, has two living children she pays little attention to, has turned the running of the house over to her slave, Mariah, and spends her time dressed in black walking around in the dark or lying down lamenting her loss. She is a morbid figure from the outset but becomes less so as the novel progresses. The death going on all around her shakes her out of her torpor, but death is definitely her comfort zone.</p><p> One of the soldiers who is treated at the house is Zachariah Cashwell, who loses his leg when Carrie sends him to surgery rather than watch him die. They are inextricably bound in some kind of a spiritual dance from then on. Their reasons for being drawn to each other are inexplicable, apparently, because they remain unexplained, and when Cashwell tells Carrie he loves her, she beats him nearly to death because she loves him too. At least, that is the reason Hicks gives. He violates that first caveat given to all writers: "show us, don't tell us." There is doubtless something deeply flawed in Carrie and screamingly symbolic about her behavior; it is surely elusive. Too bad, because Carrie was a real person whom Hicks lauds for her compassion and ability to grieve without end. Then, he throws in this gratuitous "love story" and confuses the issue. Carrie's relationship with her husband and children remains unexamined. Hicks is better at describing death and "the stink of war" than he is at life. If you read <i>War and Peace</i> and loved all the war parts and were bored senseless by the peace parts, this is your cup of tea. <i>--Valerie Ryan</i></p>Robert Hicks has been active in the music industry in Nashville for twenty years as both a music publisher and artist manager. The driving force behind the perservation and restoration of the historic Carnton plantation in Tennessee, he stumbled upon the extraordinary role that Carrie McGavock played during and after the Battle of Franklin.</p><h2>The Final Quest (The Final Quest Series)</h2><p>The Final Quest is a panoramic vision of the ultimate quest.

In All the Promises of the Bible, Dr. Herbert Lockyer discusses the nature of God&#x2019;s promises&#x2015;their substance � simplicity � surety � source � security � scope.Lockyer&#x2019;s in-depth look at the scope of God&#x2019;s promises arranges them in categories that cover the full array of human concerns, from the spiritual to the material and the corporate to the personal. As you come to understand God&#x2019;s promises and how they apply to every aspect of your life, you&#x2019;ll gain a trust in God that will sustain you through the worst of times and be your source of rejoicing in the best.</p><p>Dr. Herbert Lockyer was born in London in 1886, and held pastorates in Scotland and England for 25 years before coming to the United States in 1935.

The brothers and their friend Caitlin love exploring the extravagant corridors, long elegant staircase and grand Rotunda of Lewis Ginter&#x2019;s historic structure.<br> <br> When the hotel opened back in 1895, real alligators roamed free in the courtyard fountains. But that was ages ago...or was it? A bellman&#x2019;s mysterious tales of missing items and creepy sounds and shadows make the danger seem much more real.<br> <br> After the wedding rings disappear and Sam is blamed, there&#x2019;s no time to waste to learn the truth and recover the rings. But who is the real culprit? The friendly bellman, the disgruntled young son of the groom, or could it really be an alligator?<br> <br> To save the wedding and clear Sam&#x2019;s name, the kids must follow clues through secret passageways and hidden rooms deep within the hotel. But if they're not careful, they might become dinner for the Jefferson&#x2019;s most unusual guests. <br> <br> Secret of the Staircase is the fourth book in The Virginia Mysteries series, but it can also be read as a standalone.

I have always been very interested in art &#x2013; it always seemed like a lot of fun.<br>One of the major advantages of growing up in a family of artists is the support you receive while learning your art form. It was also a unique experience. One year for my birthday, my parents made me a kid-sized cardboard castle out of refrigerator boxes in our backyard. It took me a few years to realize that not all my friends' parents were as creative as mine.<br>My initial interest in digital art came about at a young age. I started using Commodore 64's when I was eleven or twelve, and by age thirteen, I could do basic programming. Since then, I was always interested in how companies made computer games, and I think that's what ultimately led me to 3-D design.<br>In 1991, I attended the California Institute of the Arts, where I studied drama and advanced my interest in art created on the computer. Then, in 1993, I decided to enroll in the innovative San Francisco State Multimedia Center, where I pursued my long-standing interest in designing computer programs by studying animation and 3-D modeling.<br>This year I joined my family's creative team and illustrated my first book, The Christmas Adventure of Space Elf Sam. The book took me over two years to make, and it was a true family collaboration. My mom wrote the story and my dad, Don Wood, functioned as art director.<br>I love telling stories with my art, and picture books are just that.

THE LINGERING scent of bleach is mixing with the fresh white paint on the walls, and I wish my teacher would open the window to let in a breeze. But we&#x2019;re on the third floor so the pane is sealed shut&#x2014;just in case anyone gets the urge to jump.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m still staring at the paper on my desk when Kendra Phillips turns around in her seat, looking me over with her purple contacts. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not done yet?&#x201d;<br> <br>I glance past her to make sure Mrs. Portman is distracted at the front of the room, and then I smile. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s far too early in the morning to properly psychoanalyze myself,&#x201d; I whisper. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d almost rather learn about science.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe a coffee spiked with QuikDeath would help you focus on the pain.&#x201d;<br> <br>My expression falters; just the mention of the poison enough to send my heart racing. I hold Kendra&#x2019;s empty stare&#x2014;a deadness behind it that even purple contacts can&#x2019;t disguise. Her eyes are ringed with heavy circles from lack of sleep, and her face has thinned sharply. She&#x2019;s exactly the kind of person who can get me in trouble, and yet I can&#x2019;t look away.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve known Kendra for years, but we&#x2019;re not really friends, especially now. Not when she&#x2019;s been acting depressed for close to a month. I try to avoid her, but today there&#x2019;s something desperate about her that I can&#x2019;t ignore. Something about the way her body seems to tremble even though she&#x2019;s sitting still.<br> <br>&#x201c;God, don&#x2019;t look so serious,&#x201d; she says, lifting one bony shoulder. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just kidding, Sloane. Oh, and hey,&#x201d; she adds as if just remembering the real reason she turned to me in the first place. &#x201c;Guess who I saw last night at the Wellness Center? Lacey Klamath.&#x201d;<br> <br>She leans forward as she tells me, but I&#x2019;m struck silent. I had no idea that Lacey was back.<br> <br>Just then the door opens with a loud click. I glance toward the front of the classroom and freeze, my breath catching in my throat. The day has just become significantly worse.<br> <br>Two handlers with crisp white jackets and comb-smoothed hair stand in the doorway, their expressionless faces traveling over us as they seek someone out. When they start forward, I begin to wilt.<br> <br>Kendra spins around in her seat, her back rigid and straight. &#x201c;Not me,&#x201d; she murmurs, her hands clasped tightly in front of her like she&#x2019;s praying. &#x201c;Please, not me.&#x201d;<br> <br>From her podium, Mrs. Portman begins her lesson as if there&#x2019;s no interruption. As if people in white coats should be waltzing in during her speech on the kinetic theory of matter. It&#x2019;s the second time the handlers have interrupted class this week.<br> <br>The men separate to opposite sides of the classroom, their shoes tapping on the linoleum floor as they come closer. I look away, opting to watch the leaves fall from the trees outside the window instead. It&#x2019;s October, but the summer has bled into fall, bathing us all in unexpected Oregon sunshine. I wish I could be anywhere else right now.<br> <br>The footsteps stop, but I don&#x2019;t acknowledge them. I can smell the handlers near me&#x2014;antiseptic, like rubbing alcohol and Band-Aids. I don&#x2019;t dare move.<br> <br>&#x201c;Kendra Phillips,&#x201d; a voice says gently. &#x201c;Can you please come with us?&#x201d;<br> <br>I hold back the sound that&#x2019;s trying to escape from behind my lips, a combination of relief and sympathy. I refuse to look at Kendra, terrified that the handlers will notice me. Please don&#x2019;t notice me.<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Kendra says to them, her voice choked off. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sick.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ms. Phillips,&#x201d; the voice says again, and this time I have to look. The dark-haired handler leans to take Kendra by the elbow, guiding her from the chair. Kendra immediately lashes out, yanking her arm from his grasp as she tries to clamor over her desk.<br> <br>Both men descend on her as Kendra thrashes and screams. She&#x2019;s barely five feet, but she&#x2019;s fighting hard&#x2014;harder than the others. I feel the tension rolling off the rest of the class, all of us hoping for a quick resolution. Hoping that we&#x2019;ll make it another day without getting flagged.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sick!&#x201d; Kendra yells, breaking from their hold once again.<br> <br>Mrs. Portman finally stops her lesson as she looks on with a pained expression. The calm she tries to exude is fraying at the edges. Next to me a girl starts crying and I want to tell her to shut up, but I don&#x2019;t want to attract attention. She&#x2019;ll have to fend for herself.<br> <br>The dark-haired handler wraps his arms around Kendra&#x2019;s waist, lifting her off the floor as she kicks her legs out. A string of obscenities tears from her mouth as saliva leaks from the corners. Her face is red and wild, and all at once I think she&#x2019;s sicker than we ever imagined. That the real Kendra is no longer in there, and maybe hasn&#x2019;t been since her sister died.<br> <br>My eyes well up at the thought, but I push it down. Down deep where I can keep all my feelings until later when there&#x2019;s no one watching me.<br> <br>The handler puts his palm over Kendra&#x2019;s mouth, muffling her sounds as he whispers soothing things into her ear, continuing to work her bucking body toward the door. The other handler dashes ahead to hold it open.<br> <br>Just then the man holding Kendra screams out and drops her, shaking his hand as if she bit him. Kendra jumps up to run and the handler lunges for her, his closed fist connecting with her face. The shot sends her into Mrs. Portman&#x2019;s podium before knocking her to the ground. The teacher gasps as Kendra flops in front of her, but Mrs. Portman only backs away.<br> <br>Kendra&#x2019;s top lip is split wide open and leaking blood all over her gray sweater and the white floor. She barely has time to process what happened when the handler grabs her by the ankle and begins to drag her&#x2014;caveman style&#x2014;toward the exit. Kendra screams and begs. She tries to hold on to anything within her reach, but instead she&#x2019;s leaving a trail of blood along the floor.<br> <br>When they finally get to the doorway, she raises her purple eyes in my direction, reaching out a reddened hand to me. &#x201c;Sloane!&#x201d; she screams. And I stop breathing.<br> <br>The handler pauses, glancing over his shoulder at me. I&#x2019;ve never seen him here before today, but something about the way he&#x2019;s watching me now makes my skin crawl, and I look down.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t lift my head again until I hear the door shut. Kendra&#x2019;s shouts are promptly cut off in the hallway, and I wonder momentarily if she was Tasered or injected with a sedative. Either way, I&#x2019;m glad it&#x2019;s over.<br> <br>Around the room, there are several sniffles, but it&#x2019;s mostly silent. Blood still covers the front of the room in streaks of crimson.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sloane?&#x201d; the teacher asks, startling me. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t gotten your daily assessment yet.&#x201d; Mrs. Portman starts toward the closet where she keeps the bucket and mop, and other than the high lilt of her voice, she has no noticeable reaction to Kendra being dragged from our class.<br> <br>I swallow hard and apologize, moving to take my pencil from my backpack. As my teacher sloshes the bleach on the floor, choking us with the smell once again, I begin to shade in the appropriate ovals.<br> <br>In the past day have you felt lonely or overwhelmed?<br> <br>I stare down at the bright white paper, the same one that waits at our desk every morning. I want to crumple it into a ball and throw it across the room, scream for people to acknowledge what just happened to Kendra. Instead I take a deep breath and answer.<br> <br>NO.<br> <br>This isn&#x2019;t true&#x2014;we all feel lonely and overwhelmed. Sometimes I&#x2019;m not sure there&#x2019;s another way to feel. But I know the routine. I know what a wrong answer can do. Next question.<br> <br>I fill in the rest of the ovals, pausing when I get to the last one, just like I do every time. Has anyone close to you ever committed suicide?<br> <br>YES.<br> <br>Marking that answer day after day nearly destroys me. But it&#x2019;s the one question where I have to tell the truth. Because they already know the answer.<br> <br>After signing my name at the bottom, I grab my paper with a shaky hand and walk up to Mrs. Portman&#x2019;s desk, standing in the wet area where Kendra&#x2019;s blood used to be. I try not to look down as I wait for my teacher to put away the cleaning products.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; I tell her again when she comes to take the sheet from me. I notice a small smudge of blood on her pale pink shirtsleeve, but don&#x2019;t mention it.<br> <br>She looks over my answers, and then nods, filing the paper in the attendance folder. I hurry back to my seat, listening to the tense silence. I wait for the sound of the door, the approaching footsteps. But after a long minute, my teacher clears her throat and goes back to her lesson on friction. Relieved, I close my eyes.<br> <br>Teen suicide was declared a national epidemic&#x2014;killing one in three teens&#x2014;nearly four years ago. It always existed before that, but seemingly overnight handfuls of my peers were jumping off buildings, slitting their wrists&#x2014;most without any known reason. Strangely enough, the rate of incidence among adults stayed about the same, adding to the mystery.<br> <br>When the deaths first started increasing, there were all sorts of rumors. From defective childhood vaccines to pesticides in our food&#x2014;people grasped for any excuse. The leading view says that the oversupply of antidepressants changed the chemical makeup of our generation, making us more susceptible to depression.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know what I believe anymore, and really, I try not to think about it. But the psychologists say that suicide is a behavioral contagion. It&#x2019;s the old adage &#x201c;If all your friends jumped off a bridge, would you, too?&#x201d; Apparently the answer is yes.<br> <br>To fight the outbreak, our school district implemented the pilot run of The Program&#x2014;a new philosophy in prevention. Among the five schools, students are monitored for changes in mood or behavior, flagged if a threat is determined. Anyone exhibiting suicidal tendencies is no longer referred to a psychologist. Instead, the handlers are called.<br> <br>And then they come and take you.<br> <br>Kendra Phillips will be gone for at least six weeks&#x2014;six weeks spent in a facility where The Program will mess with her mind, take her memories. She&#x2019;ll be force-fed pills and therapy until she doesn&#x2019;t even know who she is anymore. After that they&#x2019;ll ship her off to a small private school until graduation. A school designated for other returners, other empty souls.<br> <br>Like Lacey.<br> <br>My phone vibrates in my pocket and I let out a held breath. I don&#x2019;t have to check to know what it means&#x2014;James wants to meet. It&#x2019;s the push I need to get through the rest of the period, the fact that he&#x2019;s waiting for me. The fact that he&#x2019;s always waiting for me.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>As we file out of the classroom forty minutes later, I notice the dark-haired handler in the hallway, watching us. He seems to take extra time on me, but I try hard not to notice. Instead I keep my head down and walk quickly toward the gymnasium to find James.<br> <br>I check over my shoulder to make sure no one is following me before turning down the stark white corridor with the metal double doors. It&#x2019;s nearly impossible to trust anyone not to report you for suspicious behavior. Not even our parents&#x2014;especially not our parents.<br> <br>It was Lacey&#x2019;s father who called The Program to tell them that she was unwell. So now James, Miller, and I do everything we can to keep up the front at home. Smiles and small talk equal well-balanced and healthy. I wouldn&#x2019;t dare show my parents anything else. Not now.<br> <br>But once I turn eighteen, The Program loses its hold on me. I won&#x2019;t be a minor so they can no longer force me into treatment. Although my risk doesn&#x2019;t technically lower, The Program is bound to the laws of the land. I&#x2019;ll be an adult, and as an adult it&#x2019;s my God-given right to off myself if I so please.<br> <br>Unless the epidemic gets worse. Then who knows what they&#x2019;ll do.<br> <br>When I get to the gymnasium doors, I push on the cold metal bar and slip inside. It&#x2019;s been years since this part of the building was used. The Program cut athletics immediately after taking over, claiming it added too much competitive stress to our fragile student population. Now this space is used for storage&#x2014;unused desks piled in the corner, stacks of unneeded textbooks.<br> <br>&#x201c;Anyone see you?&#x201d;<br> <br>I jump and look at James as he stands in the cramped space underneath the folded bleachers. Our space. The emotionless armor I&#x2019;ve been wearing weakens.<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I whisper. James holds out his hand to me and I meet him in the shadows, pressing myself close to him. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a good day,&#x201d; I murmur against his mouth.<br> <br>&#x201c;It rarely is.&#x201d;<br> <br>James and I have been together for over two years&#x2014;since I was fifteen. But I&#x2019;ve known him my entire life. He&#x2019;d been best friends with my brother, Brady, before he killed himself.<br> <br>I choke on the memory, like I&#x2019;m drowning in it. I pull from James and bang the back of my head on the corner of the wooden bleacher above us. Wincing, I touch my scalp, but don&#x2019;t cry. I wouldn&#x2019;t dare cry at school.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let me see,&#x201d; James says, reaching to rub his fingers over the spot. &#x201c;You were probably protected by all this hair.&#x201d; He grins and lets his hand glide into my dark curls, resting it protectively on the back of my neck. When I don&#x2019;t return his smile, he pulls me closer. &#x201c;Come here,&#x201d; he whispers, sounding exhausted as he puts his arms around me.<br> <br>I hug him, letting the images of Brady fade from my head, along with the picture of Lacey being dragged from her house by handlers. I slide my hand under the sleeve of James&#x2019;s T-shirt and onto his bicep where his tattoos are.<br> <br>The Program makes us anonymous, strips us of our right to mourn&#x2014;because if we do, we can get flagged for appearing depressed. So James has found another way. On his right arm he&#x2019;s keeping a list in permanent ink of those we&#x2019;ve lost. Starting with Brady.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m having bad thoughts,&#x201d; I tell him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Then stop thinking,&#x201d; he says simply.<br> <br>&#x201c;They took Kendra last period. It was horrible. And Lacey&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Stop thinking,&#x201d; James says again, a little more forcefully.<br> <br>I look up at him, the heaviness still in my chest as I meet his eyes. It&#x2019;s hard to tell in the shadows, but James&#x2019;s eyes are light blue, the sort of crystal blue that can make anyone stop with just a glance. He&#x2019;s stunning that way.<br> <br>&#x201c;Kiss me instead,&#x201d; he murmurs. I lean forward to press my lips to his, letting him have me in a way that only he can. A moment filled with sadness and hope. A bond of secrets and promises of forever.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s been two years since my brother died. Practically overnight, our lives were changed. We don&#x2019;t know why Brady killed himself, why he abandoned us. But then again, no one knows what&#x2019;s causing the epidemic&#x2014;not even The Program.<br> <br>Above us the bell for class rings, but neither James nor I react. Instead James&#x2019;s tongue touches mine and he pulls me closer, deepening our kiss. Although dating is allowed, we try to keep our relationship low-key at school, at least when we can. The Program claims that forming healthy bonds keeps us emotionally strong, but then again, if it all goes horribly wrong, they can just make us forget. The Program can erase anything.<br> <br>&#x201c;I swiped my dad&#x2019;s car keys,&#x201d; James whispers between my lips. &#x201c;What do you say we go skinny-dipping in the river after school?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How about you get naked and I&#x2019;ll just watch?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Works for me.&#x201d;<br> <br>I laugh, and James gives me one more squeeze before taking his arms from around me. He pretends to fix my hair, really just messing it up more. &#x201c;Better get to class,&#x201d; he says finally. &#x201c;And tell Miller he&#x2019;s invited to watch me swim naked too.&#x201d;<br> <br>I back away, first kissing my fingers and then holding them up in a wave. James smiles.<br> <br>He ...</p><h2>Motives: Why Do I Do the Things I Do (Resources for Changing Lives)</h2><p>People are complex. There is behavior that we see and motives that we don't. Behind the <i>what we do</i> of our lives is the <i>why we do it</i>.<br>Edward T. Welch challenges us to peer more closely into the <i>why</i>. He insightfully reveals that, according to God's Word, the heart is the source of all human motivation. Our hearts contain motives such as pleasure, happiness, meaning, power, comfort, control, success, peace, freedom, reputation, respect, and love/intimacy.<br>Welch encourages us to ask questions to discover some of our deeper motives: <br><br>- What do you hope for, want, crave?<br><br>- What do you fear? What do you worry about?<br><br>- When do you say, "If only . . ."?<br>There are 26 other helpful booklets in the Resources for Changing Lives series.</p><p>EDWARD T.

Unfortunately, most men have spent much of their lives giving away that sovereignty. Every time a man passes blame or shirks his responsibility, every time he makes excuses for his performance, and every time he trades his unlimited potential for a little perceived safety and security, he willingly submits himself to the mercy of others. Is it any wonder that men, in general, seem to have lost their way? You don&#x2019;t have to look very far to recognize that men don&#x2019;t seem to possess the same amount of vigor and purpose they once did. Take one sobering statistic&#x2014;the rate of suicide in men&#x2014;and you begin to see how damaging the effects of the voluntary subjugation of men to their families, their businesses, and their governments can be. It&#x2019;s not hard to understand why we give up control to others&#x2014;it&#x2019;s easy and we&#x2019;re expected to. Sovereignty: The Battle for the Hearts and Minds of Men is a call for men to once again rise up and establish themselves as they once were&#x2014;a revolution if you will. Inside the pages of this book, we&#x2019;ll uncover the battle each man will inevitably engage in, the external forces fighting against the call to masculinity, and the internal struggle all men must overcome. But make no mistake, this revolution is not a call for men to go their own way and rally against society. It&#x2019;s a call for men to become fully the men they are meant to be so they may more adequately take care of themselves and those they are responsible for. Men have always been expected to protect, provide, and preside over themselves, their families, their businesses, and their communities. By embodying the thirteen Sovereign Virtues we detail inside, every man will be more capable of fulfilling his masculine duties and responsibilities. The words in this book go well beyond principle and theory, however, as we build the framework for establishing a battle plan to combat the external and internal threats to our masculine power and give every man the tools, resources, guidance, direction, and ability to reclaim what has always been his: his sovereignty.</p><p>Ryan Michler is a husband, father, Iraq combat veteran, and the founder of Order of Man and the Iron Council. Ryan grew up without a permanent father figure and has seen firsthand how a lack of strong, ambitious, self-sufficient men has impacted society today. He believes many of the world&#x2019;s most complicated problems could be solved if men everywhere learned how to be better husbands, fathers, businessmen, and community leaders. It has now become his life&#x2019;s mission to help men across the planet step more fully into their roles as protectors, providers, and presiders over themselves, their families, their businesses, and their communities."There are those who speak only of what they have heard. Then there are those who speak of what they have earned in dark nights of the soul and sacrifices too numerous to name. Ryan Michler is in this latter category. He teaches us to reclaim what we have lost and he does so as one who has battled himself to win himself again.

We cannot arrive at heaven&#x2019;s gates hoping for leniency. &#x201c;It is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment&#x201d; (Hebrews 9:27). We cannot come pleading for special favors once we have slipped from this life into eternity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Our Only Hope</strong></p><p>Our only hope is for God to give us credit for righteous perfection we could never attain on our own.&nbsp; Once such righteousness is credited to our account we can enter heaven immediately at death without so much as an intermediate stop. As the Bible says, &#x201c;away from the body and at home with the Lord&#x201d; (2 Corinthians 5:8).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here&#x2019;s how that&#x2019;s possible: When Christ died on the cross, He offered himself as a sacrifice for sinners, which God accepted. &#x201c;For our sake he [God] made him [Christ] to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God&#x201d; (2 Corinthians 5:21). Though Christ was perfect, God made Him <em>legally guilty</em> of all of our sins. In turn, those who believe that Christ did this for them receive credit for his righteousness before God.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Christ was considered to be a sinner when he took <em>our</em> sins on himself. In turn God considers us to be saints when we receive <em>Christ&#x2019;s</em> righteousness. God has exceedingly high standards, but thanks to him, he meets them for us through this amazing exchange. It&#x2019;s the only way we could ever enter God&#x2019;s heaven!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A New Nature</strong></p><p>When we receive Christ&#x2019;s righteousness, God also changes our whole perspective. Christ said, &#x201c;Unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God&#x201d; (John 3:3). So, how can we receive the gift of righteousness and be &#x201c;born again&#x201d;?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The answer is to admit our helplessness and sinfulness to God, and to acknowledge that we are dependent on his mercy. We must have a complete change of mind about whatever we were believing would make us acceptable to God. Instead we must transfer all of our trust to Christ as our sin-bearer. We must believe in Him as the One who did all that we will ever need to stand in God&#x2019;s holy presence. To &#x201c;believe in Christ&#x201d; means that as best we know, <em>we trust Him alone</em> for all that we need to please God in this life and to live with him forever in heaven.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here is a prayer that you may want to use if you desire to transfer your trust to Christ alone for your eternal salvation. And if you pray in faith, God will receive you.</p><p>Dear God, I know I&#x2019;m a sinner and there is nothing that I can do to save myself. I confess my complete helplessness to forgive my own sin or to work my way to heaven. At this moment I trust Christ alone as the One who took on all my sins when he died on the cross. I believe that he did everything necessary for me to live someday in your holy presence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I thank you that Christ was raised from the dead. As best as I know how, I transfer my trust to him. I am grateful that you have promised to receive me despite my many sins and failures. Father, I take you at your word. I thank You that I can face death now that Christ is my Savior. Thank you for the assurance that you will walk with me through death&#x2019;s door. Thank you for hearing my prayer. In Jesus&#x2019; name, amen.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Where will you be...one minute after you die?</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><b>"One minute after you die you will either be elated or terrified.

He drives Red Truck up the slippery hill, past the other vehicles that can&#x2019;t quite make it,&nbsp;to haul&nbsp;the school bus to the top. As the intrepid rescuer speeds up a slope, the words read, &#x201c;Can Red Truck make it UP the hill? Red truck CAN! / Red Truck WILL!&#x201d; Strong, flowing lines and highly simplified forms create a certain retro look in the digital artwork. Color used&nbsp;with restraint makes the red truck, yellow school bus, and brightly dressed children show up brilliantly against the background of whites, grays, and pale greens.&nbsp; As Red Truck struggles up the hill, the perpetual smile on its bumper transforms into a grimace of concentrated effort, but it resolves into the familiar uplifted curve when the job is done. With&nbsp;a well-crafted text spiced with sound effects, this appealing picture book is highly recommended for reading aloud to the truck-loving crowd.

However, it truly has the potential of reconnecting you with a loved one you may have felt was lost to you because of cognitive loss.</p><p></p><h2>The Power of Awareness</h2><p>With the words, &#34;Do not try to change people; they are only messengers telling you who you are. Revalue yourself and they will confirm the change,&#34; Goddard invites us to resist the temptation toward judgment and to look at ourselves for the change we want to see in the world an in others. &#34;God&#39;s promise is unconditional; God&#39;s law is conditional, and comes in its own good time. If you do not experience it in this life,&#34; he said, &#34;You pass through a door, that&#39;s all that death is, and you are restored to life instantly in a world like this, and you go on there with the same problems you had here with no loss of identity.&#34;</p><p><b>Neville Goddard</b> is well known as one of the most influential teachers and writers of metaphysical work.

And it all begins when Myron&#x2019;s ex tells him he&#x2019;s a father . . . of a dying thirteen-year-old boy.<br> &nbsp;<br> A surprise visit from an ex-girlfriend is unsettling enough. But Emily Downing&#x2019;s news brings Myron to his knees. Her son Jeremy is dying and needs a bone marrow transplant from a donor who has vanished without a trace. Then comes the real shocker: Jeremy is Myron&#x2019;s son, conceived the night before Emily&#x2019;s wedding to another man. Myron is determined to help him. But finding the missing donor means cracking open a dark mystery that involves a broken family, a brutal kidnapping spree, and the FBI. And as doubts emerge about Jeremy&#x2019;s true paternity, a child vanishes, igniting a chain reaction of heartbreaking truth and chilling revelation.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Praise for <i>Darkest Fear</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;Suspenseful . . . a slam dunk . . .

And if that's not enough to turn his life upside down, the reappearance of his first serious girlfriend is. The basketball star turned sports agent, who does a little detecting when business is slow, is saddened by the news that Emily Downing's 13-year-old son is dying and desperately needs a bone marrow transplant; even if she did leave him for the man who destroyed his basketball career, he wouldn't wish tsuris like that on anyone. And he's not at all interested in getting involved with Emily again, not even to track down the one mysterious donor who may be able to save the boy. But when Myron learns that Jeremy Downing is his <i>own</i> son, conceived the night before Emily and Greg Downing married, he embarks on a search for someone who disappeared a lifetime ago. And what he finds leads him to a powerful family determined to keep an old secret, a disgraced reporter who may have plagiarized a novel to create a serial killer, a very interested FBI agent, and a missing child. <p> This is the seventh outing in a series that's been gaining in popularity since Bolitar's first appearance, in Harlan Coben's <i>Deal Breaker</i>. Myron's a bit of a baby, but he's not afraid to get rough when the situation calls for it, he's eminently likable, and his heart's in the right place. The fireworks are supplied by his friend and partner, Win, who really deserves a series of his own, and Esperanza, the lesbian wrestler-lawyer who has finally talked Myron into making her a partner in the business. Like Coben's other Bolitar novels, she's worth every penny. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>6 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Bronze Key (Magisterium #3) (3)</h2><p>From Holly Black and Cassandra Clare comes the third installment in the New York Times bestselling series that defies what you think you know about the worlds of good and evil.</p><p>Holly Black is the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of The Spiderwick Chronicles (with Tony DiTerlizzi) and the Newbery Honor&#x2013;winning novel <i>Doll Bones</i>.

Focusing on the funerary symbols one would be likely to see in Egypt or at a museum, and illustrated with hieroglyphs that are on display in the British Museum (drawn by Richard Parkinson, curator in the Department of Egyptian Antiquities at the British Museum), <i>How to Read Egyptian Hieroglyphs</i> makes possible a deeper appreciation not just of museum displays but of the Egyptian culture that used this writing system.<p> Both experts in Egyptology (Collier teaches Egyptology at the University of Liverpool, and Manley teaches the subject at the University of Glasgow), they explain how most hieroglyphs are used to convey the <i>sound</i> of the ancient Egyptian language, then go on to teach, in easily digestible segments, the basic phonograms (sound-signs) used in inscriptions a traveler or museum-goer would be most likely to encounter. Each chapter teaches a new portion of hieroglyphic script and a new aspect of the Middle Egyptian grammar, with a section to practice the new reading skills and exercises to solidify the lessons taught. It provides a wonderful opportunity to sit at home and learn about the pharaonic administration, ancient Egyptian family life, and the Egyptian way of death, while building a firm understanding of the most common features of hieroglyphs. <i>--Stephanie Gold</i></p><b>Mark Collier</b> is Lecturer in Egyptology at the University of Liverpool. <b>Bill Manley</b> teaches Egyptology at the University of Glasgow.

Charts and a half-assed, handwritten flight plan whip by my face and through the cockpit door into the main cabin. In the rear of the plane our director of photography, Evan, who has been filming out the open door, is suddenly thrust forward toward the edge of open space, only to be yanked to a stop by his four-point harness. Documents eject past him and into oblivion.<br> <br>The sound is deafening and the pressure change so abrupt that I try to brace my arm against the roof to steady myself. Instead, my hand is forcefully bent back by what feels like icicles slicing through my fingers, and I instinctively retract.<br> <br><i>Open air.</i> I&#x2019;m immediately overwhelmed by a terrible realization. <i>The cockpit ceiling is gone.</i><br> <br>Our audio engineer, Mike, has the common sense to kick the pilot&#x2019;s door shut from his first-row seat behind me, closing off the wind tunnel coursing through the interior of the plane and sealing me into the roofless cockpit.<br> <br>Moments ago I was actually bored, fiddling with a camcorder to get a close-up of the plane&#x2019;s antiquated controls and weathered gauges, the altimeter needle quivering from the vibration of the plane&#x2019;s beleaguered engine. The pilot, a stout Russian in a thick wool sweater, was languidly operating the stick. Now I&#x2019;m craning back to get a view of the tail stabilizer through the gaping maw above me, praying the debris from the roof hasn&#x2019;t clipped it on the way by. I think twice about unbuckling my harness for a better look and instead concentrate on the ground below, which is getting closer by the second.<br> <br>I probably shouldn&#x2019;t be surprised by any of this, of course. As the host of the Syfy Channel&#x2019;s <i>Destination Truth</i>, I&#x2019;ve spent the last four years traveling to far-flung locales following reports of cryptozoological creatures and paranormal phenomena. Since there aren&#x2019;t exactly nonstop commercial flights leading directly to the doorsteps of the world&#x2019;s most enduring mysteries, I&#x2019;ve made a career, such as it is, out of flying on board the planet&#x2019;s most laughably derelict aircraft.<br> <br>But even by my admittedly lax standards, this plane is a piece of shit. I arrived at the airfield (and I do mean field) after two straight days of begging our field producer, Allison, to procure a plane&#x2014;any plane&#x2014;that could take us up and over the purportedly haunted Hoia Baciu Forest, the subject of our current episode. After exhausting every possible charter from here to Bucharest, she managed to find this flying Russian coffin and offered a few bucks to a local pilot to coax it back into active service.<br> <br>The Antonov An-2 is not the sort of plane most people would agree to climb aboard in the first place. Basically unchanged since its design in 1946, it has wings covered in fabric, not metal. The plane is a flying dinosaur, originally intended for agricultural use. A function it might still fulfill as it threatens to fertilize nearby farms with the remains of my crew.<br> <br>It is common in moments of potentially fatal catastrophe for the world to close in around us and become much smaller. Disaster is often countermanded by an intense focus, even if it happens to resolve on strange and seemingly arbitrary details. Looking over at the captain, I&#x2019;m suddenly engrossed by his bald head. Where once there was a comical comb-over, there is now this emancipated ribbon of hair dancing in the vortex and joyfully reaching up to the heavens. It looks like one of those inflatable noodles outside a used-car dealership. Like any pilot worth his salt, though, he seems utterly unfazed by his new coif or by our circumstances in general. Where can one buy a little of that <i>Right Stuff</i> bravado required to shrug off the fact that your airplane is now a convertible?<br> <br>When Captain Chesley Sullenberger famously ditched that crippled US Airways jet in the Hudson River after a flock of geese turned themselves into engine-flavored p�t�, it barely seemed to raise his pulse. He casually noted to air traffic control, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re gonna be in the Hudson,&#x201d; as though he was stopping off there for a cup of coffee. My distress call would have consisted of a jumbled litany of swearwords arranged in no particular order followed by an ecstatic, <i>&#x201c;Holy JESUS we&#x2019;re going to crash into a river! MOMMY!&#x201d;</i> During this particular aviation mishap, I do my best to stay calm and not soil my pants. This is the best I can muster under the circumstances, and I&#x2019;m feeling fairly heroic about it.<br> <br>The pilot adjusts the flaps and begins to bank around toward an open field. Time continues to slow down, and I think about the circumstances that brought me to this moment.<br> <br><i>How did it come to this? How on earth did I end up here, plummeting in a partially disassembled biplane toward some anonymous field in Romania?</i> A few years ago this would have been inconceivable. But now it&#x2019;s just another day at the office. I manage to catch the pilot&#x2019;s gaze for only a moment; above the din he leans over and yells, <i>&#x201c;We must go back.&#x201d;</i><br> <br>Indeed. We must.

From Athena to Alexander the Great and from Egypt to Ethiopia, Bees explores different methods of beekeeping and uncovers the debt that humans owe this vital species. With beautifully accessible illustrations depicting everything from bee anatomy to the essentials of honey making, readers will be captivated by the endless wonders of this seemingly small speck of the animal kingdom.<br></p><p><b>Piotr Socha</b> studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw. He has worked as an illustrator for many newspapers and magazines.<br>Gr 4&#x2013;6&#x2014;Comical and informative, this oversize, weighty compendium from Poland introduces an impressive array of bee and human history. Two-page topical entries are dominated by large, detailed illustrations with text running along the lower half of the pages. Bee bodies and behavior; hive building; social roles; the work of pollinating and honey production; the relationship between bees and prehistoric people, ancient Greeks, and Egyptians; and many, many other topics race along here. Illustrations of enlarged bees and humorous, stylized people are fun but also suggest that the work is meant to entertain more than inform. Some topics and explanations are sophisticated (biometrics, the Emperor Nero's wife Poppaea Sabina), and some are sketchy (how does pollen actually produce beets and cabbages?). Animal threats to bees are described, and the collapse of bee colonies in the United States in recent years is also mentioned. There's plentiful coverage of beekeeping throughout history and in today's world. Many topics nicely augment and complement other books on this familiar insect. However, the lack of typical nonfiction text features (table of contents, index, etc.) does limit the title's usefulness. VERDICT This big, browsable offering would be attractive where there's curriculum emphasis on bees or community interest in beekeeping.&#x2014;Margaret Bush, Simmons College, Boston</p><h2>After Suicide: There&#39;s Hope for Them and for You</h2><p>Addressing the hard issue of suicide simply and pastorally, Fr. Chris Alar, MIC, and Jason Lewis, MIC, draw from the teaching of the Church, the message of Divine Mercy, and their own experience of losing a loved one to offer readers two key forms of hope: hope for the salvation of those who&#39;ve died by their own hand, and hope for the healing of those left behind. This book is a must-read for all those trying to make sense out of such a difficult subject. Remarkably, the spiritual principles of healing and redemption apply not only to a loss from suicide, but by any cause of death.</p><p>Do those who take their own lives automatically lose their salvation? How can we help those who have lost a loved one to suicide? Addressing the hard issue of suicide simply and pastorally, Fr. Chris Alar, MIC,draws from the teaching of the Church, the message of Divine Mercy, and his own experience of losing his grandmother to suicide in order to offer readers two key forms of hope. With co-author Jason Lewis, MIC,Fr. Chris reveals that there's hope for the salvation of those who've died by their own hand, and there's hope for the healing of those whom they've left behind. This book is a must-read for all those trying to make sense out of such a difficult subject. Remarkably, the spiritual principles of healing and redemption apply not only to a loss from suicide, but by any cause of death.<br>Alar and Lewis offer a fresh and compelling take on how to view prayer. Based on the fact that God is all-knowing (<i>omniscient</i>) and all-powerful (<i>omnipotent</i>),they explain how God's eternal being "outside of time" enables one's prayers to be effective to any point in time, including the past. This gives hope to all who have lost a loved one -- that we can make a difference in the salvation of someone we love with our prayers and offerings, even years later, to assist them at the moment of their death. Supported by saints, theologians, and the liturgical prayers of the Church, these teachings, when applied, can result in amazing grace and the salvation of millions of souls who may have otherwise been lost.<br><i></i><br><i>Alar and Lewis have dared to deal with such a sensitive subject in a way few others have: from the perspective of Church teaching and from the aspect of spirituality, which many abandon in the midst of such a tragedy.</i>Pastorally sensitive and committed to sharing orthodox teaching, thisbook unpacks the treasures of the Church's teaching, Sacraments, anddevotions to bring real, transforming grace into the struggle ofgrieving suicide, and encourages readers to take advantage of theresources available to them as they confront one of the worst tragedies a person can face: grieving the loss of a family member, friend, orneighbor to suicide. <i></i></p><h2>Calligraphy: A Complete Guide</h2><p>Learn and master the beautiful and varied art of Western calligraphy.

In the wrong hands, the crystal could be deadly. So Luke had to find this treasure and find it fast....</p><p><b>Alan Dean Foster</b> has written in a variety of genres, including hard science fiction, fantasy, horror, detective, western, historical, and contemporary fiction. He is the author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller<i> Star Wars: The Approaching Storm</i> and the popular Pip &amp; Flinx novels, as well as novelizations of several films, including <i>Transformers, Star Wars, </i>the first three <i>Alien</i> films, and <i>Alien Nation</i>. His novel <i>Cyber Way</i> won the Southwest Book Award for Fiction, the first science fiction work ever to do so. Foster and his wife, JoAnn Oxley, live in Prescott, Arizona.I<br> &nbsp;<br> HOW beautiful was the universe, Luke thought. How beautifully flowing, glorious and aglow like the robe of a queen. Ice-black clean in its emptiness and solitude, so unlike the motley collage of spinning dust motes men called their worlds, where the human bacteria throve and multiplied and slaughtered one another. All so that one might say he stood a little higher than his fellows.<br> &nbsp;<br> In depressed moments he felt sure there was no really happy living matter on any of those worlds. Only a plethora of destructive human diseases which fought and raged constantly against one another, a sequence of cancerous civilizations which fed on its own body, never healing yet somehow not quite dying.<br> &nbsp;<br> A particularly virulent strain of one of those cancers had killed his own mother and father, then his Aunt Beru and Uncle Owen. It had also taken from him the man he had learned to respect more than any other, the elderly Jedi knight Ben Kenobi.<br> &nbsp;<br> Although he had seen Kenobi struck by the lightsaber of Darth Vader on board the now obliterated Imperial Deathstar battle station, he could not be certain the old wizard was truly dead. Vader&#x2019;s saber had left only empty air in its wake. That Ben Kenobi had departed this plane of existence was unarguable. What no one could tell was what level of existence he had passed into. Maybe death and&nbsp;...<br> &nbsp;<br> Maybe not.<br> &nbsp;<br> There were times when Luke experienced an agreeably crawly sensation, as if someone were lurking just behind him. That unseen presence occasionally seemed to move arms and legs for him, or to supply suggestions and thoughts when his own mind was helplessly blank. Blank as that of the former farm boy of Tatooine&#x2019;s desert world.<br> &nbsp;<br> Unseen spirits or not, Luke reflected grimly, if there was one thing he was sure of it was that the callow youth he had once been was dead and dry as dust. In the Rebel Alliance of worlds struggling against the corrupt rule of the Imperial government he held no formal title. But no one taunted him or called him farm boy&#x2014;not since he had helped destroy the bloated battle station secretly built by Governor Moff Tarkin and his henchman Darth Vader.<br> &nbsp;<br> Luke had no experience with titles, hence no use for them. When the Rebel leaders offered him any reward within their ability to grant, he had asked only to be permitted to continue piloting a fighter in the Alliance&#x2019;s service. Some thought his request unduly modest, but one shrewd general disagreed, explaining how Luke might be more valuable to the Rebellion without a title or commission which, the veteran pointed out to his colleagues, would serve only to make the youth a prime target for Imperial assassination. So Luke remained the pilot he&#x2019;d always wanted to be, perfecting his flying skills and always, unceasingly, wrestling with the Force Ben Kenobi had enabled him to begin to understand.<br> &nbsp;<br> No time for meditating now, he reminded himself as he studied the instruments of his X-wing fighter. A glance forward showed the brilliant pulsing sunball of Circarpous Major, its devastating radiance stopped down to viewable intensity by the phototropic material of the transparent port itself.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Everything okay back there, Artoo?&#x201d; he called into his pickup. A cheerful beep from the stubby &#x2019;droid locked in position behind the cockpit assured Luke that it was.<br> &nbsp;<br> Their destination was the fourth planet out from this star. Like so many others, the Circarpousians were appalled by the atrocities perpetrated by the Empire, but too paralyzed by fear to openly join the Rebel Alliance. Over the years, a burgeoning underground movement had arisen on Circarpous, an underground needing only enough aid and encouragement from the Alliance to rise and swing their world to the cause of freedom.<br> &nbsp;<br> From the tiny, hidden Rebel station on the outermost planet of the system, Luke and the Princess were racing to a critically important meeting with the heads of that underground, to offer the necessary promise of support. He checked his console chronometer. They would arrive in plenty of time to reassure the highly nervous underground chiefs.<br> &nbsp;<br> Leaning slightly forward and glancing to starboard, he could admire the sleek Y-wing fighter cruising alongside. Two figures sat silhouetted by instrument lights within its cockpit. One was the gleaming golden shape of See Threepio, Artoo&#x2019;s &#x2019;droid companion.<br> &nbsp;<br> The other&nbsp;...&nbsp;whenever he looked at her, the other caused emotions to boil within him like soup too long on the fire, no matter if she was separated from him by near vacuum as at present or by only an arm&#x2019;s length in a conference room. It was for and because of that individual, Princess and Senator Leia Organa of the now-vaporized world of Alderaan, that Luke had originally become involved in the Rebellion. First her portrait and then her person had initiated the irreversible metamorphosis from farm boy to fighter pilot. Now the two of them were the official emissaries from the ruling council of the Rebel government to the vacillating underground on Circarpous.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sending her on so dangerous a mission, Luke had thought from the first, was a risk. But a second system was ready to commit itself to the Alliance, if it was announced that Circarpous had also joined. At the same time, if that second system would declare its defiance of the Empire, then the Circarpousian underground would undoubtedly come over to the side of the Rebellion. So not one, but two systems waited on the outcome of this mission. And if it failed, Luke knew, both systems would probably lose heart and withhold their desperately needed aid. They had to succeed.<br> &nbsp;<br> Luke had no doubts, as he silently adjusted his ship&#x2019;s altitude a quarter of a degree to the plane of the solar ecliptic, about the outcome of their mission. He couldn&#x2019;t imagine anyone who could not be persuaded by Princess Leia. She could convince him of anything. Luke treasured those moments when she forgot her station and titles. He dreamed of a time when she might forget them forever.<br> &nbsp;<br> A beep from behind woke Luke from his day-dreaming, wiped the smile from his face. They were preparing to pass close by Circarpous V, and Artoo was reminding him of it. A vast, cloud-shrouded globe, the planet was listed in Luke&#x2019;s library as being mostly unexplored, save for a single early Imperial scouting expedition. According to the computer readout, it was also known to the Circarpousians as Mimban, and&nbsp;...&nbsp;His intership communicator dinged for attention.<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m receiving you, Princess.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Her reply was filled with irritation. &#x201c;My port engine is beginning to generate unequal radiation pulses.&#x201d; Even when bothered, to him that voice was as naturally sweet and pleasing as sugar-laden fruit.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;How bad?&#x201d; he inquired, frowning worriedly.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Bad enough, Luke.&#x201d; The words sounded strained. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m losing control already, and the inequality&#x2019;s getting worse. I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;m going to be able to compensate. We&#x2019;ll have to stop at the first base down below on Mimban and have the problem corrected.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Luke opened his mouth to reply, did so after hesitating briefly. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t possibly make it safely to Circarpous IV?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so, Luke. I might make near-orbit, but then we&#x2019;d have to deal with official repair systems and couldn&#x2019;t set down as planned. We&#x2019;d miss the meeting, and we can&#x2019;t miss it. Resistance groups from all over the Circarpous system are going to be there. If I don&#x2019;t arrive, they&#x2019;ll panic. We&#x2019;ll have one Stang of a time getting them to surface again. And the Circarpous worlds are vital to the Rebellion, Luke.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I still don&#x2019;t think&nbsp;...&#x201d; he began.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t make me make it an order, Luke.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Biting back his initial response, he hurriedly began a check of visual readout charts and records. &#x201c;According to my information tapes, Mimban doesn&#x2019;t have a repair station, Leia. In fact,&#x201d; he added with a glance at the murky green-white sphere below and to one side, &#x201c;Mimban might not even have an emergency standby station.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t matter, Luke. I have to make the conference, and I&#x2019;m going down while I still have some real control. Surely, in a system as populous as this one, any world with a breathable atmosphere&#x2019;s going to be equipped with facilities for emergency repair. Your data must be old or else you&#x2019;re searching the wrong tapes.&#x201d; A pause, then, &#x201c;You can prove it by shifting your communicator monitor to frequency oh-four-six-one.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Luke adjusted the requisite controls. Instantly a steady whine filled the small cabin.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sound familiar?&#x201d; she asked him.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a directional landing beacon, all right,&#x201d; he replied, confused. Several further queries, however, revealed no records of a station on Mimban. &#x201c;But there&#x2019;s still nothing in the listings on either Imperial or Alliance tapes. If we&nbsp;...&#x201d; He broke off as a puff of gas glowed brightly from the Princess&#x2019; Y-wing, expanded brightly and vanished. &#x201c;Leia! Princess Leia!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Her small ship was already curving away from him. &#x201c;Lost lateral controls completely now, Luke! I&#x2019;ve got to go down!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Luke rushed to match her glide path. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t deny the presence of the beacon. Maybe we&#x2019;ll be lucky! Try to shift power to your port controls!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m doing the best I can.&#x201d; A brief silence, followed by, &#x201c;Stop moving around, Threepio, and watch your ventral manipulators!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> A contrite, metallic, &#x201c;Sorry, Princess Leia,&#x201d; sounded from her cabin companion, the bronzed human-cyborg relations &#x2019;droid See Threepio. &#x201c;But what if Master Luke is correct and there is no station below? We could find ourselves marooned forever on this empty world, without companionship, without knowledge tapes, without&nbsp;...&nbsp;without lubricants!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Five Negro Presidents: According to what White People Said They Were</h2><p>Historian Joel Augustus Rogers provides his evidence that there have been nineteenth- and twentieth-century presidents of the United States who had partial black ancestry, including Harding, Jefferson, Jackson and Lincoln.</p><p>JOEL AUGUSTUS ROGERS (September 6, 1880&#x2013;;March 26, 1966) was a Jamaican-American author, journalist, and historian who contributed to the history of Africa and the African diaspora, especially the history of African Americans in the United States. His research spanned the academic fields of history, sociology and anthropology. He challenged prevailing ideas about race, demonstrated the connections between civilizations, and traced African achievements. He was one of the greatest popularizers of African history in the twentieth century. Rogers addresses issues such as the lack of scientific support for the idea of race, the lack of black history being told from a black person's perspective, and the fact of intermarriage and unions among peoples throughout history. A respected historian and gifted lecturer, Rogers was a close personal friend of the Harlem-based intellectual and activist Hubert Harrison. In the 1920s, Rogers worked as a journalist on the Pittsburgh Courier and the Chicago Enterprise, and he served as the first black foreign correspondent from the United States."If America hadn't already invented the 'one-drop rule' by this time, Rogers most probably would have. He seems to have had some sort of miscegenation-meter, which he used to 'out' all sorts of 'white' people as having black ancestry. And while he erred on the side of excess as he peered into the proverbial woodpile, Rogers got it right an impressive amount of the time, especially considering when he was publishing his work. (At the other end of his collected works, though, stands The Five Negro Presidents, which, shall we say, would get the Black History Wishful Thinking Prize, hands down, were there such in existence.)"&#x2015;Henry Louis Gates, Jr., <i>The Root</i></p><h2>The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values</h2><p>Sam Harris&#x2019;s first book, <i>The End of Faith</i>, ignited a worldwide debate about the validity of religion. In the aftermath, Harris discovered that most people&#x2014;from religious fundamentalists to non-believing scientists&#x2014;agree on one point: science has nothing to say on the subject of human values. Indeed, our failure to address questions of meaning and morality through science has now become the primary justification for religious faith.<br><br>In this highly controversial book, Sam Harris seeks to link morality to the rest of human knowledge. Defining morality in terms of human and animal well-being, Harris argues that science can do more than tell how we are; it can, in principle, tell us how we ought to be. In his view, moral relativism is simply false&#x2014;and comes at an increasing cost to humanity. And the intrusions of religion into the sphere of human values can be finally repelled: for just as there is no such thing as Christian physics or Muslim algebra, there can be no Christian or Muslim morality. Using his expertise in philosophy and neuroscience, along with his experience on the front lines of our &#x201c;culture wars,&#x201d; Harris delivers a game-changing book about the future of science and about the real basis of human cooperation.</p><p><strong>Richard Dawkins on <em>The Moral Landscape</em></strong> <p> </p> <p><strong>Richard Dawkins is the Charles Simonyi Professor of the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford, a position he has held since 1995. Among his books are <em>The Greatest Show on Earth</em>, <em>The Ancestor's Tale</em>, <em>The God Delusion</em>, <em>The Selfish Gene</em>, <em>The Blind Watchmaker</em>, <em>Climbing Mount Improbable</em>, <em>Unweaving the Rainbow</em>, and <em>A Devil's Chaplain</em>. <br></strong></p> <p>Beautifully written as they were (the elegance of his prose is a distilled blend of honesty and clarity) there was little in Sam Harris's previous books that couldn't have been written by any of his fellow "horsemen" of the "new atheism." This book is different, though every bit as readable as the other two. I was one of those who had unthinkingly bought into the hectoring myth that science can say nothing about morals. To my surprise, <em>The Moral Landscape</em> has changed all that for me. It should change it for philosophers too. Philosophers of mind have already discovered that they can't duck the study of neuroscience, and the best of them have raised their game as a result. Sam Harris shows that the same should be true of moral philosophers, and it will turn their world exhilaratingly upside down. As for religion, and the preposterous idea that we need God to be good, nobody wields a sharper bayonet than Sam Harris. <em>--Richard Dawkins</em></p> <strong>Amazon Exclusive: Q &amp; A &#x2013; Sam Harris</strong><br> <p><strong>Q: </strong>Are there right and wrong answers to moral questions?</p> <p><strong>Harris: </strong>Morality must relate, at some level, to the well-being of conscious creatures. If there are more and less effective ways for us to seek happiness and to avoid misery in this world&#x2014;and there clearly are&#x2014;then there are right and wrong answers to questions of morality.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>Are you saying that science can answer such questions?</p> <p><strong>Harris: </strong>Yes, in principle. Human well-being is not a random phenomenon. It depends on many factors&#x2014;ranging from genetics and neurobiology to sociology and economics. But, clearly, there are scientific truths to be known about how we can flourish in this world. Wherever we can act so as to have an impact on the well-being of others, questions of morality apply.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>But can&#x2019;t moral claims be in conflict? Aren&#x2019;t there many situations in which one person&#x2019;s happiness means another&#x2019;s suffering?</p> <p><strong>Harris: </strong>There as some circumstances like this, and we call these contests ?zero-sum.? Generally speaking, however, the most important moral occasions are not like this. If we could eliminate war, nuclear proliferation, malaria, chronic hunger, child abuse, etc.&#x2014;these changes would be good, on balance, for everyone. There are surely neurobiological, psychological, and sociological reasons why this is so&#x2014;which is to say that science could potentially tell us exactly why a phenomenon like child abuse diminishes human well-being.</p> But we don&#x2019;t have to wait for science to do this. We already have very good reasons to believe that mistreating children is bad for everyone. I think it is important for us to admit that this is not a claim about our personal preferences, or merely something our culture has conditioned us to believe. It is a claim about the architecture of our minds and the social architecture of our world. Moral truths of this kind must find their place in any scientific understanding of human experience. <p></p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>What if some people simply have different notions about what is truly important in life? How could science tell us that the actions of the Taliban are in fact immoral, when the Taliban think they are behaving morally?</p> <p><strong>Harris: </strong>As I discuss in my book, there may be different ways for people to thrive, but there are clearly many more ways for them not to thrive. The Taliban are a perfect example of a group of people who are struggling to build a society that is obviously less good than many of the other societies on offer. Afghan women have a 12% literacy rate and a life expectancy of 44 years. Afghanistan has nearly the highest maternal and infant mortality rates in the world. It also has one of the highest birthrates. Consequently, it is one of the best places on earth to watch women and infants die. And Afghanistan&#x2019;s GDP is currently lower than the world&#x2019;s average was in the year 1820. It is safe to say that the optimal response to this dire situation&#x2014;that is to say, the most moral response&#x2014;is not to throw battery acid in the faces of little girls for the crime of learning to read. This may seem like common sense to us&#x2014;and it is&#x2014;but I am saying that it is also, at bottom, a claim about biology, psychology, sociology, and economics. It is not, therefore, unscientific to say that the Taliban are wrong about morality. In fact, we must say this, the moment we admit that we know anything at all about human well-being.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>But what if the Taliban simply have different goals in life?</p> <p><strong>Harris: </strong>Well, the short answer is&#x2014;they don&#x2019;t. They are clearly seeking happiness in this life, and, more importantly, they imagine that they are securing it in a life to come. They believe that they will enjoy an eternity of happiness after death by following the strictest interpretation of Islamic law here on earth. This is also a claim about which science should have an opinion&#x2014;as it is almost certainly untrue. There is no question, however, that the Taliban are seeking well-being, in some sense&#x2014;they just have some very strange beliefs about how to attain it.</p> In my book, I try to spell out why moral disagreements do not put the concept of moral truth in jeopardy. In the moral sphere, as in all others, some people don&#x2019;t know what they are missing. In fact, I suspect that most of us don&#x2019;t know what we are missing: It must be possible to change human experience in ways that would uncover levels of human flourishing that most of us cannot imagine. In every area of genuine discovery, there are horizons past which we cannot see. <p></p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>What do you mean when you talk about a moral landscape?</p> <p><strong>Harris: </strong>This is the phrase I use to describe the space of all possible experience&#x2014;where the peaks correspond to the heights of well-being and valleys represent the worst possible suffering. We are all someplace on this landscape, faced with the prospect of moving up or down. Given that our experience is fully constrained by the laws of the universe, there must be scientific answers to the question of how best to move upwards, toward greater happiness.</p> This is not to say that there is only one right way for human beings to live. There might be many peaks on this landscape&#x2014;but there are clearly many ways not to be on a peak. <p></p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>How could science guide us on the moral landscape?</p> <p><strong>Harris: </strong>Insofar as we can understand human wellbeing, we will understand the conditions that best secure it. Some are obvious, of course. Positive social emotions like compassion and empathy are generally good for us, and we want to encourage them. But do we know how to most reliably raise children to care about the suffering of other people? I&#x2019;m not sure we do. Are there genes that make certain people more compassionate than others? What social systems and institutions could maximize our sense of connectedness to the rest of humanity? These questions have answers, and only a science of morality could deliver them.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>Why is it taboo for a scientist to attempt to answer moral questions?</p> <p><strong>Harris: </strong>I think there are two primary reasons why scientists hesitate to do this. The first, and most defensible, is borne of their appreciation for how difficult it is to understand complex systems. Our investigation of the human mind is in its infancy, even after nearly two centuries of studying the brain. So scientists fear that answers to specific questions about human well-being may be very difficult to come by, and confidence on many points is surely premature. This is true. But, as I argue in my book, mistaking no answers in practice for no answers in principle is a huge mistake.</p> The second reason is that many scientists have been misled by a combination of bad philosophy and political correctness. This leads them to feel that the only intellectually defensible position to take when in the presence of moral disagreement is to consider all opinions equally valid or equally nonsensical. On one level, this is an understandable and even noble over-correction for our history of racism, ethnocentrism, and imperialism. But it is an over-correction nonetheless. As I try to show in my book, it is not a sign of intolerance for us to notice that some cultures and sub-cultures do a terrible job of producing human lives worth living. <p><strong>Q: </strong>What is the difference between there being no answers in practice and no answers in principle, and why is this distinction important in understanding the relationship between human knowledge and human values?</p> <p><strong>Harris: </strong>There are an infinite number of questions that we will never answer, but which clearly have answers. How many fish are there in the world&#x2019;s oceans at this moment? We will never know. And yet, we know that this question, along with an infinite number of questions like it, have correct answers. We simply can&#x2019;t get access to the data in any practical way.</p> There are many questions about human subjectivity&#x2014;and about the experience of conscious creatures generally&#x2014;that have this same structure. Which causes more human suffering, stealing or lying? Questions like this are not at all meaningless, in that they must have answers, but it could be hopeless to try to answer them with any precision. Still, once we admit that any discussion of human values must relate to a larger reality in which actual answers exist, we can then reject many answers as obviously wrong. If, in response to the question about the world&#x2019;s fish, someone were to say, ?There are exactly a thousand fish in the sea.? We know that this person is not worth listening to. And many people who have strong opinions on moral questions have no more credibility than this. Anyone who thinks that gay marriage is the greatest problem of the 21st century, or that women should be forced to live in burqas, is not worth listening to on the subject of morality. <p></p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>What do you think the role of religion is in determining human morality?</p> <p><strong>Harris: </strong>I think it is generally an unhelpful one. Religious ideas about good and evil tend to focus on how to achieve well-being in the next life, and this makes them terrible guides to securing it in this one. Of course, there are a few gems to be found in every religious tradition, but in so far as these precepts are wise and useful they are not, in principle, religious. You do not need to believe that the Bible was dictated by the Creator of the Universe, or that Jesus Christ was his son, to see the wisdom and utility of following the Golden Rule.</p> The problem with religious morality is that it often causes people to care about the wrong things, leading them to make choices that needlessly perpetuate human suffering. Consider the Catholic Church: This is an institution that excommunicates women who want to become priests, but it does not excommunicate male priests who rape children. The Church is more concerned about stopping contraception than stopping genocide. It is more worried about gay marriage than about nuclear proliferation. When we realize that morality relates to questions of human and animal well-being, we can see that the Catholic Church is as confused about morality as it is about cosmology. It is not offering an alternative moral framework; it is offering a false one. <p></p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>So people don&#x2019;t need religion to live an ethical life?</p> <p><strong>Harris: </strong>No. And a glance at the lives of most atheists, and at the most atheistic societies on earth&#x2014;Denmark, Sweden, etc.&#x2014;proves that this is so. Even the faithful can&#x2019;t really get their deepest moral principles from religion&#x2014;because books like the Bible and the Qur&#x2019;an are full of barbaric injunctions that all decent and sane people must now reinterpret or ignore. How is it that most Jews, Christians, and Muslims are opposed to slavery? You don&#x2019;t get this moral insight from scripture, because the God of Abraham expects us to keep slaves. Consequently, even religious fundamentalists draw many of their moral positions from a wider conversation about human values that is not, in principle, religious. We are the guarantors of the wisdom we find in scripture, such as it is. And we are the ones who must ignore God when he tells us to kill people for working on the Sabbath.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>How will admitting that there are right and wrong answers to issues of human and animal flourishing transform the way we think and talk about morality?</p> <p><strong>Harris: </strong>What I&#x2019;ve tried to do in my book is give a framework in which we can think about human values in universal terms. Currently, the most important questions in human life&#x2014;questions about what constitutes a good life, which wars we should fight or not fight, which diseases should be cured first, etc.&#x2014;are thought to lie outside the purview of science, in principle. Therefore, we have divorced the most important questions in human life from the context in which our most rigorous and intellectually honest thinking gets done.</p> Moral truth entirely depends on actual and potential changes in the well-being of conscious creatures. As such, there are things to be discovered about it through careful observation and honest reasoning. It seems to me that the only way we are going to build a global civilization based on shared values&#x2014;allowing us to converge on the same political, economic, and environmental goals&#x2014;is to admit that questions about right and wrong and good and evil have answers, in the same way the questions about human health do. <p></p>Sam Harris is the author of the bestselling books&nbsp;<i>The End of Faith</i>, <i>Letter to a Christian Nation</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Moral Landscape</i>,&nbsp;<i>Free Will</i>, and <i>Lying</i>.&nbsp;<i>The End of Faith</i>&nbsp;won the 2005 PEN Award for Nonfiction.

The Complete Paintings</h2><p><p>A century after his death, Viennese artist Gustav Klimt (1862&#x2013;1918) still startles with his unabashed eroticism, dazzling surfaces, and artistic experimentation. This monograph gathers all of Klimt&#x2019;s major works alongside authoritative art historical commentary and privileged access to the artist&#x2019;s archive.</p><p>With top quality illustration, including new photography of the celebrated Stoclet Frieze, the book follows Klimt through his prominent role in the Secessionist movement of 1897, his candid rendering of the female body, and his lustrous &#x201c;golden phase&#x201d; when gold leaf brought a shimmering tone and texture to such beloved works as The Kiss and Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I, also known as The Woman in Gold.</p><p>Through luminous spreads and carefully curated details, the monograph traces the repertoire of Japanese, Byzantine, and allegorical stimuli that informed Klimt&#x2019;s flattened perspectives, his symbolic vocabulary, and his mosaic-like textures. Drawing upon contemporary critics and voices, the book also examines the art world&#x2019;s polarized reception to Klimt&#x2019;s pictures as much as his own stylistic trajectory. From his landscape painting to erotic works to the controversial ceiling for the Great Hall of the University of Vienna, we see how Klimt&#x2019;s admixture of tradition and daring divided the press and public&#x2015;becried by some as a pornographer, hailed by others as a modern maestro.</p></p><p>Tobias G.

James and Patricia Cornwell.</p><p>In this fascinating book, Judith Flanders retells the gruesome stories of many different types of murder&#x2015;both famous and obscure&#x2015;from the crimes (and myths) of Sweeney Todd and Jack the Ripper to the tragedies of the murdered Marr family in London's East End; Burke and Hare and their bodysnatching business in Edinburgh; and Greenacre, who transported his dismembered fianc�e around town by omnibus. With an irresistible cast of swindlers, forgers, and poisoners, the mad, the bad and the dangerous to know, The Invention of Murder is both a gripping tale of crime and punishment, and history at its most readable.</p></p><p>JUDITH FLANDERS is a <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author and one of the foremost social historians of the Victorian era.

She lives in London.&nbsp; <p>ONE</p> <p>Imagining Murder</p> <p>&#x2018;Pleasant it is, no doubt, to drink tea with your sweetheart, but most disagreeable to find her bubbling in the tea-urn.&#x2019; So wrote Thomas de Quincey in 1826, and indeed, it is hard to argue with him. But even more pleasant, he thought, was to read about someone else&#x2019;s sweetheart bubbling in the tea urn, and that, too, is hard to argue with, for crime, especially murder, is very pleasant to think about in the abstract: it is like hearing blustery rain on the windowpane when sitting indoors. It reinforces a sense of safety, even of pleasure, to know that murder is possible, just not here. At the start of the nineteenth century, it was easy to think of murder that way. Capital convictions in the London area, including all the outlying villages, were running at a rate of one a year. In all of England and Wales in 1810, just fifteen people were convicted of murder out of a population of nearly ten million: 0.15 per 100,000 people. (For comparison purposes, in Canada in 2007&#x2013;08 the homicide rate was 0.5 per 100,000 people, in the EU, 1.8 per 100,000, in the USA 2.79, while Moscow averaged 9.6 and Cape Town 62 per 100,000.)</p> <p>Thus, when on the night of 7 December 1811 a twenty-four-year-old hosier named Timothy Marr, his wife, their baby and a fourteen-year-old apprentice were all found brutally murdered in their shop on the Ratcliffe Highway in the East End of London, the cosy feeling evaporated rapidly. The year 1811 had not been kind to the working classes. The French wars had been running endlessly, and with Waterloo four years in the future, there was no sense that peace &#x2013; and with it prosperity &#x2013; would ever return. Instead hunger was ever-present: the wars and bad harvests had savagely driven up the price of bread. In the early 1790s wheat had cost between 48s. and 58s. a quarter; in 1800 it was 113s.</p> <p>The murder of the Marrs, however, was more dramatic than the slow deaths of so many from hunger, or the faraway deaths of soldiers and sailors in unending war, and the story was soon everywhere. The Ratcliffe Highway was a busy, populous working-class street in a busy, populous working-class area near the docks. At around midnight on the evening of his death, Marr was ready to shut up shop. (Working-class shops regularly stayed open until after ten, to serve their clientele on their way home after their fourteen-hour workdays. On Saturdays, pay day, many shops closed after midnight.) The hosier sent his servant, Margaret Jewell, to pay an outstanding bill at the baker&#x2019;s, and to buy the family supper. After paying the bill she looked for an oyster stall. Oysters were a common supper food, being cheap, on sale at street stalls and needing no cooking. The first stall she came to had shut up for the night, and looking for another she lost her bearings &#x2013; before gas lighting streets had only the occasional oil lamp in a window to guide passers-by &#x2013; and was away for longer than expected, returning around 1 a.m.* She knocked; knocked again. She heard scuffling, someone breathing on the other side of the door, but no one opened it. She stopped the parish watchman on his rounds, telling him she knew the Marrs were in, she had even heard them, but no one was answering the door. He had passed by earlier, he said, and had tapped on the window to tell Marr that one of his shutters was loose. A man had called out, &#x2018;We know it!&#x2019; Now he wondered who had spoken.</p> <p>Their talking attracted the attention of Marr&#x2019;s next-door neighbour, a pawnbroker. From his window he could see that the Marrs&#x2019; back door was open. With the encouragement of the neighbours and the watchman, he climbed the fence between the houses and entered (some reports say it was the watchman who entered). Whichever man it was, once inside he found a scene from a horror film. Marr and his apprentice were lying in the shop, battered to death. The apprentice had been attacked so ferociously that fragments of his brains were later found on the ceiling. Blood was everywhere. Mrs Marr was lying dead halfway to the door leading downstairs. The pawnbroker staggered to the front door, shouting, &#x2018;Murder &#x2013; murder has been done!&#x2019; and the watchman swung his rattle to summon help. Soon an officer from the Thames Division Police Office appeared. Meanwhile Margaret Jewell rushed in with a group of excited bystanders, looking for the baby. They found him lying in his cradle in the kitchen, his throat cut. Some money was scattered on the shop counter, but �150 Marr had tucked away was untouched. On the counter lay an iron ripping chisel, which seemed not to have been used; in the kitchen, covered with blood and hair, was a ship&#x2019;s carpenter&#x2019;s peen maul &#x2013; a hammer with sharpened ends. A razor or knife must have been used on the baby, but none was found. Outside the back door were two sets of bloody footprints, and a babble of voices reported that a couple of men, maybe more, no one was quite sure, had been seen running away from the general direction of the Marrs&#x2019; house at more or less the right time.</p> <p>In the morning, a magistrate from the Thames Division Police Office took over the case. An officer from the Thames Division Police Office had responded the night before, and therefore the magistrates at the Thames Office were now in charge. A magistrate ordered the printing of handbills offering a reward, and visited the site of the murder, where the bodies lay where they had fallen the night before.</p> <p>He was not the only one. What might be termed murder-sightseeing was a popular pastime, and many went &#x2018;from curiosity to examine the premises&#x2019;, where they entered &#x2018;and saw the dead bodies&#x2019;. Inquests were held as quickly as possible after the event, usually at a public house or tavern near the scene of the crime. The bodies were left in situ for the jury to view. Until they had been, visitors traipsed through the gore-spattered rooms, peering not only at the blood splashes and other grisly reminders of the atrocity, but also at the bodies themselves.</p> <p>For those who wanted a tangible souvenir, there were always broadsides, which were swiftly on sale on street corners. Broadsides had been around since the sixteenth century, but modern technology made their production easier, cheaper and quicker, and their distribution more widespread. A typical broadside was a single sheet, printed on one side, which was sold on the street for �d. or 1d. Broadsides had their heyday before the 1850s, when newspapers were expensive. Most commonly, sheets were produced sequentially for each crime that caught the public&#x2019;s imagination: the first report of the crime, with further details as they were revealed; the magistrates&#x2019; court hearing after an arrest; then the trial; and finally, and most profitably, a &#x2018;sorrowful lamentation&#x2019; and &#x2018;last confession&#x2019;, usually combined with a description of the execution. These &#x2018;lamentations&#x2019; and execution details were almost always entirely fabricated for commercial reasons: they found their readiest sale at the gallows, while the body was still swaying. For those who could not find a penny, pubs and coffee houses pinned up broadsides of popular crimes, to be read by customers as they drank. Other broadsides appeared in shop windows, frequently attracting crowds of bloodthirsty children.</p> <p>One broadside, published before the Marrs&#x2019; inquest, which opened three days after the murders, reported that &#x2018;the perpetrators are foreigners&#x2019;, which could have done little to reassure readers in this dockyard area of town, filled with sailors from across the world. Another spent less time on the possible murderer, and more on the gory details and the rumours that were prevalent: that Mrs Marr had, several months before, discharged a servant for theft. &#x2018;Words arose, when the accused girl is said to have held out a threat of murder. Mrs. Marr&nbsp;&#x2026; gently rebuked her for using such language&#x2019;; later Mrs Marr &#x2018;remonstrated with her on her loose character and hasty temper&#x2019;. Anyone with a penny to spare would get a fair idea of the crime and the latest news of the search for the murderer.</p> <p>Those with a few more pennies could buy a pamphlet on the subject. These were available nearly as swiftly as the broadsides. One covered all the details of the inquest, so it was probably on sale within five days of the deaths. While the pamphlets looked more substantial at eight pages, much of their information was identical to that in the broadsides. In some, such similar wording is used that either they must have shared an author, or one was copied from the other. Mrs Marr again sacks her servant, who &#x2018;is said to have held out a threat of murder. Mrs. Marr&nbsp;&#x2026; gently rebuked her for using such language&#x2019;; later she again &#x2018;remonstrated with her on her loose character and hasty temper&#x2019;. Now, however, we get the additional detail that the servant was leading a &#x2018;prostituted life&#x2019;. This is reinforced by a description of her clothes: &#x2018;a white gown, black velvet spencer [jacket], cottage bonnet with a small feather, and shoes with Grecian ties&#x2019;. No servant could afford such fashionable items: they were signs that her money was earned immorally.</p> <p>Another way to savour the thrill of murder was to attend the funerals of the victims. Many people did so out of respect, as friends or as members of the same community. But far more did so out of curiosity. Still more read about them afterwards. Even four hundred miles away the Caledonian Mercury gave a detailed account of the funeral of the murdered apprentice: its readers were able to follow the precise path of the cort�ge as it travelled &#x2018;from Ratcliffe-highway, through Well-close-square, up Well-street, to Mill-yard&#x2019;. In Hull too newspaper readers followed the crowds that turned out for the Marrs&#x2019; triple funeral: &#x2018;The people formed a complete phalanx from the [Marrs&#x2019;] house to the doors of St. George&#x2019;s church.&#x2019; The church itself was so crowded that the funeral procession could only enter &#x2018;with some difficulty&#x2019;. Then the paper gave the order of the procession, as was normally done for royal weddings and funerals, or the Lord Mayor&#x2019;s parade:</p> <p>The body of Mr. Marr;</p> <p>The bodies of Mrs. Marr and infant;</p> <p>The father and mother of Mr. Marr;</p> <p>The mother of Mrs. Marr;</p> <p>The four sisters of Mrs. Marr;</p> <p>The only brother of Mr. Marr&nbsp;&#x2026;</p> <p>The friends of Mr. and Mrs. Marr.</p> <p>Newspapers churned out stories, handbills circulated, witnesses were questioned. But none of this got any closer to finding the murderer or murderers. Then, like a recurring nightmare, twelve days after the Marrs&#x2019; deaths it all happened again. On 19 December a watchman found John Turner, half-dressed and gibbering with fear, scrambling down New Gravel Lane, a few hundred yards from the Ratcliffe Highway. He had gone to bed early at his lodgings above a public house. After closing time he heard screaming and he went part-way down the stairs, where he saw a stranger bending over a body on the floor. After a panicky attempt to leave via the skylight (he was so frightened he couldn&#x2019;t find it), Turner tied his bedsheets together and slid out of the window into the yard, shouting, &#x2018;They are murdering the people in the house!&#x2019; The watchman was quickly joined by neighbours, and they broke in through the cellar door to find, yet again, bodies lying with their heads beaten in and their throats cut. The body of John Williamson, the publican, was in the cellar; his wife Elizabeth had been in the kitchen with their servant Bridget. Only the Williamsons&#x2019; granddaughter, asleep upstairs, had escaped. Once more, money was scattered about, but little of value had been taken; once more, the escape was via the back door and over the yard fence.</p> <p></p> <p>The funeral of the murdered Marr family as it processed through the East End. The funeral mutes with their staffs and the coffins topped by plumes were watched by residents lined all the way along the route, which had been publicized by the newspapers.</p> <p>The newspapers covered the story widely, but the information they gave was not terribly helpful. The Edinburgh Annual Register described John Turner as being &#x2018;about six feet in height&#x2019;, while The Times said he was &#x2018;a short man&#x2019; with &#x2018;a lame leg&#x2019;. The Morning Chronicle described his &#x2018;large red whiskers&#x2019;, but thought he was &#x2018;about five feet nine inches&#x2019; and &#x2018;not lame&#x2019;. Turner, therefore, was either tall, short, or in-between; he was lame, or possibly not; and he had large red whiskers, unless he didn&#x2019;t. This was the description of a man who had stood in front of journalists at an inquest. Imagine how reliably the papers described the man briefly seen by Turner, or those who had been glimpsed running away from the Marrs&#x2019; house.</p> <p>The police had no more idea where to look for the perpetrators of this new outrage than they had had after the deaths of the Marrs. They arrested plenty of people: people who were violent; people who looked in some way suspicious; people against whom a grudge was held. But one by one they were questioned and released.* In small communities criminals were usually revealed fairly swiftly; in areas with larger populations, handbills with descriptions of the wanted person and offers of rewards generally brought in information, frequently from fellow criminals who found this a convenient way of earning a bit of cash and removing a competitor at the same time. With no response to the initial reward offered after the murder of the Marrs, the only thing the magistrates could think to do was increase the sum. To the initial �50 reward, another �100 was added by the Treasury, and that was increased two days later to an astonishing �700 &#x2013; a very comfortable middle-class annual income, the sign of increasing government anxiety, verging on panic. After the Williamsons were murdered, another 120 guineas was offered: twenty guineas to anyone who could identify the owner of the weapons, and 100 guineas more if that person were to be convicted of the murders.</p> <p>One man, arrested on suspicion, attempted to turn king&#x2019;s evidence, identifying eight men as his fellow murderers. Unable to come up with a motive, the newspapers attributed a love of wholesale slaughter to this mysterious gang. The gang theory was widely popular. A magistrate from the Thames Police Office wrote to his colleague at the Lambeth Street Office that the crime &#x2018;gives an appearance of a gang acting on a system&#x2019;, but to what end was not clear. Many were caught up: at one point seven men were held for questioning because &#x2018;In the possession of one of them were found two shirts stained with marks very much resembling blood, and a waistcoat carrying also similar marks&#x2026;&#x2019; The men turned out to be hop-pickers, and the stains were vine sap.</p> <p>The first clue that led towards an arrest was noticed only on the day of the Williamsons&#x2019; murder, twelve days after the death of the Marrs, when it finally registered that the peen maul found in the kitchen had the initials &#x2018;JP&#x2019; scratched on it. A handbill advertised this, and Mrs Vermiloe, the landlady of the Pear Tree Tavern, reported that her lodger, a Danish sailor named John Petersen, had left his tools in her care on his last shore leave. Petersen was at sea at the time of the murders, but his fellow lodger, John Williams, was said to have shaved off his whiskers the following day; furthermore, he had been seen washing his own stockings at the pump in the yard; and both he and another lodger, John Ritchen, knew Petersen. This was enough for an arrest. On 27 December the magistrates&#x2019; court was packed with eager spectators when the news came that Williams had committed suicide in his cell.</p> <p>The immediate reaction was that the suicide was an outright confession. Anything that contradicted this comforting notion was pushed to one side. On reflection, the questions greatly outweighed the certainties...</p></p><h2>Small Engines and Outdoor Power Equipment</h2><p><p>This new book is more than a simple engine repair manual.

You can also use co-ownership, transfer-on-death accounts, or beneficiary designations. If you have a large estate, you might also leave property to beneficiaries in more complicated ongoing trusts. No matter how you leave your property, it is better to have a plan&#x2015;if you die without one, state law will decide who gets what. </li><li> <b>Providing for young children.</b> If you have young children, you&#x2019;ll want to ensure that they will be well cared for if you die before they become adults. In your will, you can name guardians to raise them and managers to look after their inheritance. You&#x2019;ll also likely want to buy life insurance to make sure that your kids have money after you&#x2019;re gone. </li><li> <b>Planning for incapacity.</b> Part of estate planning is preparing for what will happen if you ever became unable to make medical and financial decisions for yourself. You can use a health care directive to name someone to make medical decisions on your behalf and to express your wishes about end-of-life care. You can also prepare a durable power of attorney that gives a trusted person control of your finances. Preparing these documents can save your family much heartache. </li><li> <b>Avoiding probate.</b> Probate is a court-run process for wrapping up an estate. It&#x2019;s often expensive and time-consuming, yet rarely provides any benefit to the beneficiaries. Thankfully, with a little planning, probate is fairly easy to avoid. Trusts, pay-on-death accounts, joint tenancy, and other probate avoidance methods can keep most or all of your estate out of probate, saving your loved ones time and money. </li><li> <b>Reducing estate tax.</b> Most people won&#x2019;t owe federal estate tax. But if you expect to leave over $11.4 million, you&#x2019;ll probably want to use your estate plan to reduce the tax that your estate could owe after your death. <p> (Note: This book contains no estate planning forms, but it does tell you how to get the forms you need.)</p></li></p><p>This book provides the information and encouragement you need to create an estate plan that&#39;s right for you. It shows you how to protect your property, provide for children, avoid probate and plan for incapacity. The information in this book will help you formulate your plan and will save you time and money, whether you create your own estate plan or go to a lawyer for assistance.<b>Denis Clifford,</b> a graduate of Columbia Law School, where he was an editor of The Law&nbsp;Review, is a lawyer who specializes in estate planning.

But if you're at risk for a premature birth, your experience is going to be different. Some women will be aware of their risk before they conceive. For many others, suddenly becoming a patient comes as a shocking surprise. </p><p> If you're likely to have a preterm birth, you'll probably get assistance from an obstetrician who specializes in high-risk pregnancies (called a perinatologist). Your doctor's efforts will be directed at preventing a premature birth, or postponing it as much as is possible and advisable. </p><p> Why prematurity happens is still a puzzle. In fact, experts believe most preterm births result not from a single cause, but from several risk factors interacting throughout pregnancy. Doctors know many reasons for preterm birth (as you'll see from the list on page 33), and can identify many pregnancies at risk. But about half of the expectant mothers who go into preterm labor have no known risks for it. If you've already given birth to a preemie, and you never suspected that it might happen to you, you're certainly not alone. </p><p> Perhaps even more frustrating is that in many cases, premature birth cannot be prevented, even when mothers are known to be at risk. Still, even if a premature delivery cannot be avoided, a lot can be done to delay it for at least a few days (and sometimes much longer) -- enough time to take some precautions that can greatly reduce the health risks for both you and your baby. For example, you may be admitted to a hospital, where you and your baby can be monitored twenty-four hours a day, or transferred to a facility with more expertise in perinatology and newborn intensive care. If you have an infection, you'll be started on antibiotics, to help prevent your baby from getting it, too. And you may be given steroids to help your baby's organs mature faster before birth. </p><p> Sometimes, your doctor may decide to purposely deliver your baby before term, because he is not growing or doing well in the womb, or because it has become too dangerous for your own health to continue the pregnancy. About 20 percent of all preterm births are such so-called "elective," or medically indicated preterm births. The rest occur spontaneously -- about 30 percent after a woman's water breaks too early, and about half after preterm labor. </p><p> As you read through the information below, remember that only an experienced obstetrician can evaluate your own individual case. It's important for you to develop a good, trusting relationship with your obstetrician, so that you can count on her for support, as well as for state-of-the-art medical care, as you travel the demanding road of a high-risk pregnancy. </p><p> <br> <b>Questions and Answers</b> </p><p> <b>Bed Rest</b> </p><p> <i><b>My doctor told me to go on bed rest, but I have so many things in my life I need to do. Will bed rest really help prevent an early birth?</b></i> </p><p> Nobody knows for sure. Bed rest is probably the oldest prescription for a high-risk pregnancy. Yet despite its widespread use -- one out of every five pregnant women in the United States is put on bed rest -- it has not been studied extensively. Although more research is needed before anyone can answer your question for sure, so far, the few studies that have been done have produced no convincing evidence that bed rest helps reduce preterm births. </p><p> So, why do almost all obstetricians prescribe it to women with preterm labor, premature rupture of membranes, preeclampsia, bleeding, or other pregnancy problems, and sometimes even as a preventive measure to women who are expecting multiples? Because even without proof, there are situations where bed rest makes sense to doctors, for some solid, scientific reasons. </p><p> For example, say your baby isn't growing as well as she should in the womb. Fetuses depend entirely on blood flowing through the placenta for their supply of nutrients and oxygen, and a mother's blood flow to the placenta is greatest when she is lying down. So, it makes sense that your baby will have the best chance of growing better if you spend a few extra hours in bed each day. </p><p> Or say your water has broken early. It makes sense that you could maximize the amount of fluid remaining around your baby by spending more time off your feet, since increased blood flow to the baby leads to greater production of amniotic fluid. Also, the fluid is less likely to drip out when you're lying down. </p><p> Bed rest also makes sense when gravity may be dangerous for a pregnancy. For example, once a woman's membranes have ruptured, there is a risk that the umbilical cord could slip down through her cervix -- an absolute emergency, because the cord could get caught there and squeezed, cutting off blood flow to the baby. Gravity also can be risky when a woman has a weak, or "incompetent," cervix, which could open if the fetus presses down on it too hard. </p><p> There is also good evidence that blood pressure is higher in women who are walking around. So, it is assumed that bed rest is helpful to pregnant women with preeclampsia, a condition involving high blood pressure which, when it's severe, can necessitate a premature delivery. Although research hasn't demonstrated so far whether bed rest itself makes the difference, we know there has been a dramatic improvement in the outcomes of pregnancies with pre-eclampsia. It may well have to do with the increasing use of hospitalization, which allows for both intensive monitoring and more bed rest than most women can get at home. </p><p> But if sometimes there is sound reasoning behind the prescription of bed rest, other times there is simply a mixture of observation and wishful thinking. Take preterm labor. Many doctors believe that women who remain active in the third trimester of pregnancy have more Braxton-Hicks contractions -- the normal, "false" labor contractions that don't lead to cervical change and delivery, and are of no concern. It's natural for obstetricians to extrapolate from that and assume that bed rest might reduce the risk of real labor, too. Nobody knows whether the initial observation itself, about Braxton-Hicks contractions, or the extension of it to real labor, is valid. </p><p> So far, studies on pregnant women haven't found that bed rest decreases preterm labor. (Monitoring contractions with a home monitor -- another intervention that seems like it should work -- doesn't appear to make a difference, either. Research suggests that home monitors don't improve pregnancy outcomes, although they do increase the number of doctor visits -- probably meaning they cause a lot of preterm labor scares.) But well-meaning obstetricians want to do <i>something</i> for women with preterm labor, so as long as there is a possibility that bed rest might help, many suggest it. </p><p> Some obstetricians also have observed that a prescription of bed rest can bring a helpful focus to a pregnancy. The thinking is that your pregnancy may have the best chance of succeeding if you, your family, and even your doctor focus more attention on your needs, concerns, and symptoms. Some women say this worked for them: that after trying to juggle a lot of things during the early part of their pregnancies, bed rest actually reduced their stress by allowing them to shift their emphasis away from their many other daily obligations. </p><p> Undoubtedly, obstetricians also prescribe bed rest partly as a holdover from past medical practice. As recently as a decade ago, nearly every woman with a pregnancy risk or problem was put immediately to bed, and told to stay there twenty-four hours a day. </p><p> Today, however, on top of a lack of proof of bed rest's effectiveness, there's a growing awareness of its potential costs. Total bed rest quickly causes bone and muscle loss (much of which is regained after a woman becomes active again). And for plenty of women it causes more stress, rather than less. In fact, it can be really hard on an entire family, especially when there are older children, or job and financial concerns. So, more and more doctors are recommending reduced activity -- lying down for a few hours each morning and a few hours each afternoon -- rather than complete bed rest, except in a few situations like an already open cervix, ruptured membranes, or severe preeclampsia. </p><p> Thankfully, you'll rarely see the once-common Trendelenburg position, in which a woman lies with her feet raised higher than her head. There's no evidence that it makes a difference, and a general consensus that no one can tolerate that position for long! </p><p> While you nestle in bed, try to stay as optimistic as possible (remember that medical treatments often work best when patients believe they will), and take a look at the practical tips below to make that experience more tolerable. </p><p> <b>Bed Rest Survival Tips</b> </p><p> OK. You've been put on bed rest, and you're feeling understandably miserable. How are you going to make it through the long weeks ahead? These survival tips may help: </p><p> </p><li><i><b>Recognize that you are performing a job, one of the hardest you'll ever do</b></i>. If you are an active person with a tendency to ask "What have I gotten done?" each day, it's easy to feel frustrated and inadequate while on bed rest -- unless you give yourself credit for a daily achievement: an investment in your child's and family's future. Whenever you feel like you can't take it anymore, or are about to give in to the many temptations to get up, remind yourself of the job you have to do, and focus on your goal! </li><li><i><b>Make your physical comfort a priority.</b></i> Lying down for long stretches at a time can be very uncomfortable, and aches and pains are going to make your job far more difficult. You may have heard that you should lie on your left side, because blood flow to the placenta will be greatest -- but your right side is good for your baby, too. What's most important is simply to avoid lying flat on your back, because blood flow is reduced that way. Rest a pillow under one side of your tummy or back, so you're on a slight tilt. That's fine! </li><li><i><b>Do light exercises in bed.</b></i> To avoid muscle and bone loss, some obstetricians now arrange for a physical therapist to visit their patients on complete bed rest. If your doctor doesn't mention this, don't hesitate to ask. The therapist can teach you light, isometric exercises you can do while lying down. Or you can try to make up your own, very light exercise regime: point and flex your toes, do head rolls, rotate your hands, tense and relax the muscles of your arms and legs. </li><li><i><b>Stay clean and attractive.</b></i> It's amazing how this can affect your mood. Many hospitals have arrangements with hairdressers who will come to your room and expertly wash your hair without ever asking you to sit up. If you're at home, ask friends or the staff of your hair salon if they know of a hairdresser who makes house calls. Put on makeup every morning. Some women find that when they're feeling down, it lifts their mood to pamper themselves with manicures, pedicures, or facials. </li><li><i><b>Make your environment attractive, too.</b></i> It will just take a couple of minutes for a friend or your partner to tape up some family photos or art works by your children. When you're feeling imprisoned, warm touches go a long way! </li><li><i><b>Don't expect the household to run as smoothly, or cleanly, as usual.</b></i> It's a fact of life: women on bed rest don't have clean houses! If your family eats pizza for the seventh time in a week, you're not alone, either. The best thing is to lower your expectations, recognize that these things aren't a priority right now, and plan to fix them later, when you're up and about. </li><li><i><b>Organize your space.</b></i> It's terrible to have to ask for every little thing you need. Instead, ask your partner to put a table next to your bed, with the following items within easy reach: a telephone, books and magazines, grooming items, tissues, and disposable cleansing wipes (to wash your hands), the television remote control, paper and pencil, things you need for your hobby, a water pitcher, and a lunch that your partner sets out for you each morning. No matter how much your partner wants to help, it will minimize tension between you if he doesn't have to act as your constant gofer. </li><li><i><b>Be understanding that bed rest is hard on your partner and children, too.</b></i> Your partner's life is also disrupted. He may be as worried and distressed as you are, and he's probably picking up lots of extra tasks while holding down his usual responsibilities. Try not to be resentful of him for still being able to move around, or for not being able to meet your every need. And give him as much time off as you can. It's important to keep supporting each other. <br> It's normal for your children to show some reaction, either behaving badly toward others or toward you. It's also normal for you to worry about them, and to think how long this period feels to them. But believe us, they will forget about it soon afterward. In the meantime, encourage them to spend time with you by making your bedside into a play area with their toys, and putting up a little table where they can eat some meals. Try to arrange special time for them with grandparents. Some mothers say it helped a lot for their child to be present when the doctor explained the need for bed rest; hearing it from an outside authority made the child understand better, and even eager to cooperate. </li><li><i><b>If you were working, make sure to discuss financial arrangements with your employer.</b></i> Find out if you are eligible for disability payments, and whether this time is being counted as part of your maternity leave or sick leave. Remember that the Family and Medical Leave Act requires employers with 50 or more employees to give up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave related to pregnancy problems or childbirth.

Jerry Pinkney lives with his wife, author Gloria Jean Pinkney, in Westchester County, New York.PreSchool-Grade 4 Important lessons of work ethics, initiative, and natural consequence are delivered in the latest addition to what might be considered the Pinkney classic bookshelf a lush, light-filled rendition of a folktale staple. The colorful, feather-full frontispiece features a full-page portrait of the heroine herself, wordlessly inviting children to turn the page with a cunningly crooked wing. You know the story; in this version, the jaunty, straw-hat-wearing Red Hen pops against golden, sun-bleached, full-bleed backgrounds. Her stunning farmyard neighbors dwarf her, emphasizing her stature (both physical and social). But a single mom's got to do what she's got to do to put bread on the table, and so she asks for assistance. She's a smart old bird: she flatters each animal as she appeals to him to use his particular skill (the dog is a fine digger; the rat, a champion chopper; the goat would be great at pulling; and the pig, well, at pigging) to help. Still, she's met with that familiar refrain Not I. There's a lot of heart in the details here: Pinkney puts in a self-portrait appearance as hard-working Mr. Miller, and the passage of time is subtly marked by the growth of the hen's five chicks, who begin as balls of yellow fluff and are markedly bigger by story's end. The animal's names appear in color-coded font (red for the hen, brown for the dog, etc.), making it extra-easy even for pre-readers to chime in, and the glorious, generous paintings are a real gift.

They live in Upstate New York with their two kids.PreSchool-Grade 2&#x2014;Lulu is back in this companion to <i>Ladybug Girl</i> (Dial, 2008). Taking on the guise of her superhero alter-ego (including a red tutu and spotted wings), she makes her own fun on the way to the playground by leaping over sidewalk cracks and counting to infinity. However, once she and her mother arrive, Ladybug Girl faces a new challenge: she wants to play with her friend Sam, but they can't agree on what to do. Lulu is frustrated at first, but then suggests playing the Ladybug Girl game. Sam, clad in yellow and black, quickly turns into Bumblebee Boy, and the two "zoom around...looking to help anyone in trouble." When two girls ask to join in, but both want to be Butterfly Girl, Ladybug Girl tactfully defuses the situation by saying, "If we're going to play together...we don't fight each other." One youngster agrees to be Dragonfly Girl and the Bug Squad flies again. Like the previous book, this offering paints a realistic picture of the daily struggles in a youngster's life. The conflict and resolution ring true, as does the dialogue. The lesson is clearly stated, but not heavy-handed. The cartoon illustrations are bright, expressive, and beautifully presented. Pair this book with one of Mini Grey's "Traction Man" titles (Knopf) for a superb superhero storytime.&#x2014;<i>Rachael Vilmar, Eastern Shore Regional Library, Salisbury, MD</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He&#x2019;s grown weary of the bicentennial celebrations, the angry families of patients, the rash of campers coming down from the mountains high on speed, and the midnight call-outs to cover for the town veterinarian. When his wife Susanne balks at the trip just as they&#x2019;re walking out the door&#x2014;leaving him to go it alone with his lovestruck teenage daughter Trish and eager-but-adolescent son Perry&#x2014;Patrick is wounded but determined, despite the news of a murderer escaping custody on the other side of the mountains.</p><p>After two days of rain-soaked horseback riding to hunt and fish, Patrick&#x2019;s gotten nothing but weird encounters, wet socks, and a whiny daughter. So, on the third day, when Trish begs to stay behind at their campsite to read, Patrick is secretly relieved.</p><p>Meanwhile back in town, Susanne&#x2019;s had a rough time of it herself. A break-in, a wreck, and a premonition that something is terribly wrong with her family.

She is the founder and director of the International Festival of Animation Arts, "Multivision." In 2011, she created&nbsp;FatCatArt.com&#x2014;an experiment to combine art history and the spirit of LOLcats. Her "famous paintings improved by cats" went viral and became an internet sensation. She adopted her feline coauthor and mews, Zarathustra, when her mother died. Loved and spoiled by Svetlana&#x2019;s mother, this 8-year-old ginger tabby cat is 10 kilos of pure undisturbed joy, although he is trying to diet.<p></p><p>Circa 1955, Toksovo, Russia, self-portrait by Tatiana Iskuzhina</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>How I Met Zarathustra the Cat</p><p>Perhaps you were a bit surprised to see on the cover of this book that my coauthor is not a human, but a Cat. It is not a joke or a marketing trick; the impact of Zarathustra on my work is so important that he fully deserves to be coauthor of our Fat Cat Art project.</p><p>First let me introduce myself. My name is Svetlana Petrova. I am a woman living in St. Petersburg, Russia. I am a graduate of the Faculty of Philosophy of St. Petersburg State University. After graduating with a first-class degree, I discovered that I am too independent to work in the &#x201c;system.&#x201d; So I became an artist.</p><p>In fact, I had been drawing and writing poetry from childhood. My mother taught me everything, although she was not a professional artist herself. She was an engineer and a teacher of cybernetics at the St. Petersburg Naval Institute, but she was an artist in her soul. My mother made beautiful black-and-white photos, which she then painted in aquarelle colors, such as the self-portrait on the dedication page. You can see she was a beautiful and elegant woman. So it&#x2019;s no surprise that my path in art began in the fields of fashion and theater. I created a bizarre fashion show called L.E.M.&#x2014;Laboratory of Experimental Models&#x2014;and toured it all over Europe in the nineties.</p><p>I have always been very curious and liked to investigate new fields, so I decided to become an event producer. I got acquainted with lots of interesting people in my travels and wanted to present their art in my country and so I brought to Russia some live music and theater acts. Meanwhile I was interested in implanting video screens in my costumes and did so with a screen displaying interactive moving images controlled by computer. Thus I fell in love with animation. And in 2003, I created the International Festival of Animation Arts: Multivision, now one of the oldest and biggest international animation festivals, with a professional jury, in Russia. It is famous for my large-scale video installations on the raised drawbridges over the Neva River in St. Petersburg that take place each summer.</p><p>So everything was fine, and in 2008 more than fifty thousand spectators gathered at the giant video installation on the two main bridges of St. Petersburg. It was my biggest triumph. My mother was so proud of me and we spent a wonderful time in her summerhouse, once I had recovered from the hard work.</p><p>And then my mother died.</p><p>I was her only child, and other than me she just had one beloved being, a ginger Cat, Zarathustra. Of course I adopted him after her death. Zarathustra was and is a living memory of my mother. She asked me to take care of him, and so I do, as far as I can.</p><p>Here I should say that I am very close to Cats because my family always had Cats, going as far back as we can trace our history (from the nineteenth century). I grew up with a little kitten called Marussia, or just Murka, who was the same age as me. I would say we developed some kind of telepathic liaison. It was so sad that she died from old age when I was only fifteen! So it is natural for me to understand Cats.</p><p>Then our family had an unbelievable ginger Cat called Vladimir Vorotnikov, or simply Vova. He was a philosopher and a talking Cat. You know Cats try to imitate human speech when you talk to them often. It&#x2019;s a known fact that was revealed by a group of zoological psychologists. Other zoological psychologists who differ on this point, by the way, are not worthy of their degrees!</p><p>As well as Vova, I had an adorable Cat-actor named Marcus Aurelius Wolfgang Amadeus. Marc the Cat performed in my shows <i>Swan Lake II</i> and <i>Moulin Russe</i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. wherein he played the role of the God of Mice, wearing wings made of feathers that perfectly matched in color his gray tabby fur.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Marc the Cat performing in L.E.M. theater</p><p></p><p></p><p>After my mother&#x2019;s death, I sank into the most terrible depression. I was so close to my mother. I missed her so much, and I am still missing her.</p><p>And it was Zarathustra who saved me from that depression.</p><p>One day a friend said to me: &#x201c;You created such amazing art with your Cat Marc in your L.E.M. shows. Why don&#x2019;t you do something with your new Cat, Zarathustra. He is so funny!&#x201d; And he was: he was fat; my mother spoiled him immensely. As my mother herself would say, he is &#x201c;the best Cat in the world.&#x201d;</p><p>I thought: &#x201c;Why not? It will distract me from my grief,&#x201d; and I began to think what I would do. It was useless to put wings on him like on Marc, because Zarathustra is clearly unable to fly, with his physical condition. So I thought that maybe I could make a photo session with food in the style of Dutch still-life paintings. To imagine how it would look, I decided to photoshop Zarathustra into such a painting. I had used Photoshop for sketches of the sets for my events and costumes. And I don&#x2019;t know why, but I photoshopped him into another painting, <i>Danae</i> by Rembrandt. Then I did this with four more classical paintings and sent them to some friends, who are artists and collectors, just to see their reaction.</p><p>Never before have I seen serious ladies weeping, and having to lie down, from laughing. I received so much praise: &#x201c;How naturally Zarathustra fits into the paintings!,&#x201d; &#x201c;It reveals something new in their meaning,&#x201d; something that made people happy.</p><p>The impression was so good not just because my artistic skills had been validated but because of the work of Zarathustra. In fact, he is a natural-born artist and he knows he is making art. Zarathustra adores posing when people are taking photos of him. He is always very friendly to photographers. He knows who is a photographer and begins to flatter those people. It&#x2019;s amazing how he knows!</p><p>He has found a special place for work as a model. In my apartment there is a podium covered by a big carpet&#x2014;it looks like a stage. When Zarathustra wants to pose, he shows me that I should go there, then he lies down on this carpet and begins to make very funny poses with a very serious face. He has a rich repertoire of mimicry and can make different expressive grimaces. The camera likes him.</p><p>Despite having this star character, he is a very sensitive and tender Cat, a real gentleman, or better, a &#x201c;gentlecat.&#x201d; Everybody who meets him is astonished and says that he is somebody special. He really is ten kilograms (twenty-two pounds) of pure undisturbed joy.</p><p>Concerning his weight, it may sound strange, but he eats very little. Actually, he is trying to lose weight by keeping to a very strict diet of high-quality veterinary Cat food. If on occasion he wants something tastier, he chooses only healthy treats, such as raw beef and king prawns. King prawns are his favorite food, but of course not more than three prawns per week.</p><p>My heart bleeds forcing him to be on this diet, but what can I do? However, I can say that he tolerates the diet restriction with dignity, much more dignity than I would have being on a diet.</p><p>The very positive reaction to my first experiments with Zarathustra encouraged me a lot, and I launched the site FatCatArt.com in February 2011. I put it online and then left it. I wanted to see if it would spread naturally, without any effort from my side. At that time I was occupied with other projects.</p><p>In late autumn, at the closing event of my animated film festival Multivision, one of the film directors noticed Zarathustra&#x2019;s image in my portfolio and asked me why I had this image. I answered,&nbsp;&#x201c;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. because I made it,&#x201d; to which he responded, &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you have a look at the Internet? It&#x2019;s full of your Cat!&#x201d; I explored the Internet and was astonished: Zarathustra was everywhere.</p><p>In fact, I was always interested in Internet culture. I dreamed of making an experiment: to create an Internet meme that would be both beautiful and clever. I liked this idea both practically and philosophically. This virus should bring some information, create some stimulus to know more. It should be a virus of freedom for aspiring to new knowledge and not a virus of simply repeating what has been done before.</p><p>People who discover my Cat paintings are likely to google for the originals. Of course not all of them do that, but just a few of them doing so makes it worthwhile. The &#x201c;Cat-infused&#x201d; paintings fit perfectly with my idea of a clever and beautiful meme.</p><p>Making this project has brought me a lot of knowledge also. I have studied in detail the style of the old masters, their technique. Now I can make my paintings look as if they are real paintings made by an old master, in spite of the fact I have inserted a photo of a modern kitty, using a computer.</p><p>I should say that digital media gives people incredible possibilities to interact with art. If you change something in the digital image, it doesn&#x2019;t change anything in the real world.</p><p></p></p><h2>A Baker&#39;s Life: 100 fantastic recipes, from childhood bakes to five-star excellence</h2><p><p><b>Accompanying the Channel 4 series, <i>A Baker's Life</i> contains 100 of Paul Hollywood's very best baking recipes, which have been finessed over decades spent as a baker. </b></p><p>Each chapter is filled with bakes that represent a different decade &#x2013; learning the basics at his father's bakery; honing his pastry skills in the finest hotels; discovering the bold flavours of the Middle East while working in Cyprus; and finding fame with the phenomenally popular <i>Great British Bake Off</i> television series.</p><p>Thanks to this book (and its clear step-by-step instructions), recipes that Paul has spent years perfecting can be recreated at home.

Maximum Ride is used to living desperately on the run from evil forces sabotaging her quest to save the world-but nothing has ever come as close to destroying her as this horrifying prophetic message. Fang is Max's best friend, her soul mate, her partner in the leadership of her flock of winged children. A life without Fang is a life unimaginable.<br>When a newly created winged boy, the magnificent Dylan, is introduced into the flock, their world is upended yet again. Raised in a lab like the others, Dylan exists for only one reason: he was designed to be Max's perfect other half. Thus unfolds a battle of perfection versus passion that terrifies, twists, and turns . . . and meanwhile, the apocalypse is coming.</p><p>James Patterson has had more <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers than any other writer, ever, according to <i>Guinness World Records</i>.

He writes full-time and lives in Florida with his family.<br>Max, an avian/human hybrid who was grown in a lab, is back to continue the Maximum Ride series as leader of a flock of winged kids, including her teenage soul mate, Fang. Despite the title of this book, this is still very much Max&#39;s story, most of it told in first person in the passionately wry voice of Jill Apple. By Book Six, she IS the voice of Max to listeners. What&#39;s different this time is the introduction of a new teen bird boy, Dylan, who was apparently created specifically to appeal to Max. This series is all about voice, something mastered by both Patterson and Apple. It&#39;s impossible not to like Max, a girl who lives life on a knife-edge and can never out-fly trouble.

If it wasn&#x2019;t for the new waitress at the diner, he would have stopped at just one. But damn she was cute. So he&#x2019;d sat at the counter the entirety of his dinner break and sucked down caffeine like a ten-year old gorging on Kool-aid. Brandy obliged by keeping his mug full, and entertaining him with her twenty-something chit chat and a full two inches of jiggling cleavage.<br><br>He&#x2019;d been eating at LaDonna&#x2019;s Diner every night for two months now, since the chief assigned him the graveyard shift. He hated working nights. He respected the chief, but he was going to have to have a talk with her about getting back on days.<br><br>Skid turned his cruiser onto Hogpath Road, a desolate stretch of asphalt bounded by Miller&#x2019;s Woods to the north and a cornfield on the south side. The cruiser&#x2019;s tires crunched over gravel as he pulled onto the shoulder. He was reaching for the pack of Marlboro Lights in the glove box when his radio crackled.<br><br>&#x201c;Three two four. Are you 10-8?&#x201d;<br><br>Mona was the third shift dispatcher and his sole source of entertainment&#x2014;after the diner closed, anyway. She&#x2019;d kept him from dying of boredom many a night. &#x201c;Roger that, Dispatch.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So did you talk to her?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s affirm.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You ask her out?&#x201d;<br><br>Throwing open his door to keep the smell of smoke out of the cruiser, Skid lit the Marlboro. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see how that&#x2019;s any of your business.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the one who&#x2019;s been talking about her for the last two months.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s too young for me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Since when does that make a difference?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re tying up the radio.&#x201d;<br><br>Mona laughed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re chicken.&#x201d;<br><br>Wishing he&#x2019;d never told her about his crush on Brandy, he drew on the cigarette. &#x201c;Whatever.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Are you smoking?&#x201d;<br><br>He mouthed the word shit.<br><br>&#x201c;You said you were going to quit.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I said I was going to either quit drinking or smoking. I sure as hell ain&#x2019;t going to do both in the same week.&#x201d; He sucked in a mouthful of smoke. &#x201c;Especially when I&#x2019;m stuck working nights.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe the chief&#x2019;s still pissed about that old lady you roughed up.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t rough her up. That old goat was drunk out of her mind.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She was sixty-two years old&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And naked as a jaybird.&#x201d;<br><br>Mona giggled. &#x201c;You get all the good calls.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t remind me. The sight of her wrinkled ass has damaged me for life.&#x201d; He sighed, his bladder reminding him why he&#x2019;d stopped in the first place. &#x201c;I gotta take a piss.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Like I need to know that.&#x201d; She disconnected.<br><br>Grinning, Skid got out of the cruiser. The crickets went silent as he walked around to the bar ditch. Dry cornstalks crackled in a light breeze. Beyond, a harvest moon cast yellow light onto the tall grain silo and barn roof of an Amish farm. It was so quiet, he could hear the cacophony of frogs from Wildcat Creek a quarter mile to the south. Skid relieved himself and tried not to think about the long night ahead. Yeah, he was going to have a talk with the chief. Get back on days. He&#x2019;d had enough of this vampire-hours shit.<br><br>He was zipping up when a distant sound snagged his attention. At first he thought maybe a calf was bawling for its cow. Or maybe a dog had been hit by a car. But when the sound came again, he realized it wasn&#x2019;t either of those things. It was a man&#x2019;s scream. Looking out across the cornfield, he felt the hairs at his nape stand straight up.<br>Skid rested his hand on the .38 strapped to his hip. He scanned the field beyond where the corn whispered and sighed. Another scream sent a chill scraping up his spine. &#x201c;What the hell?&#x201d;<br><br>Yanking open the door of the cruiser, he leaned in and flicked on the strobes, then pulsed the siren a couple of times. He hit his lapel mike. &#x201c;Mona, I&#x2019;m out here at the Plank farm. I&#x2019;ve got a 10-88.&#x201d; They used the ten-code radio system at the Painters Mill PD. Ten-eighty-eight was the code for suspicious activity.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Some crazy shit&#x2019;s screaming his head off.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well that&#x2019;s strange.&#x201d; She went silent for a moment. &#x201c;Who is it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, but I think it&#x2019;s coming from the house. I&#x2019;m going to check it out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Roger that.&#x201d;<br><br>Back in his cruiser, Skid turned into the long gravel lane that would take him to the house. The Planks were Amish. Generally, the Amish community was quiet and kept to themselves. Most were up before the sun and in bed before most folks finished their supper. Skid couldn&#x2019;t figure one of them out this time of night, raising hell. Either some teenager on rumspringa&#x2014;their &#x201c;running around&#x201d; time before joining the church&#x2014;was drunk out of his head, or there&#x2019;d been an accident. <br><br>He was midway down the lane when a figure rushed from the shadows. Skid braked hard. The cruiser slid sideways, missing a man by inches. &#x201c;Holy shit!&#x201d;<br><br>The man scrambled around the front of the cruiser, hands on the hood, eyes as big as baseballs. Skid didn&#x2019;t recognize him, but the full beard and flat-brimmed hat told him the guy was Amish. Setting his hand on his .38, Skid rammed the shifter into Park and got out of the cruiser. &#x201c;What the hell are you doing? I almost hit you.&#x201d;<br><br>The man was breathing hard, shaking harder. In the moonlight, Skid saw sweat glistening on his cheeks, despite the October chill, and he wondered if the guy was high on drugs. &#x201c;Mein Gott!&#x201d;<br><br>Skid didn&#x2019;t understand Pennsylvania Dutch, the Amish dialect, but he didn&#x2019;t need to be fluent to know the guy was terrified. He didn&#x2019;t know what he&#x2019;d walked into. The one thing he was certain of was that he wasn&#x2019;t going to let this cagey-looking sumbitch get any closer. As far as he knew the guy was on crack and armed with a machete. &#x201c;Stop right there, partner. Keep your hands where I can see them.&#x201d;<br><br>The Amish man put his hands up. Even from ten feet away Skid could see his entire body trembling. His chest heaved. It was tears&#x2014;not sweat&#x2014;that glistened on his cheeks. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d; Skid asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Reuben Zimmerman!&#x201d; he choked.<br><br>The Amish man&#x2019;s eyes met his. Within their depths, Skid saw fear and the sharp edge of panic. The man&#x2019;s mouth worked, but no words came.<br><br>&#x201c;You need to calm down, sir. Tell me what happened.&#x201d;<br><br>Zimmerman pointed toward the farmhouse, his hand shaking like a flag in a gale. &#x201c;Amos Plank. The children. There is blood. They are dead!&#x201d;<br><br>The guy had to be out of his mind. &#x201c;How many people?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do not know. I saw . . . Amos and the boys. On the floor. Dead. I ran.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Did you see anyone else?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>Skid&#x2019;s gaze went to the darkened farmhouse. The place was silent and still. No lantern light in the windows. No movement. He hit his lapel mike. &#x201c;Mona, I&#x2019;ve got a possible 10-16 out here.&#x201d; A 1-16 was the code for a domestic problem. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to take a look.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You still out at the Plank place?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s affirm.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You want me to call the sheriff&#x2019;s office and get a deputy out there?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to check it out first. Will you run Reuben Zimmerman through LEADS for me?&#x201d; LEADS was the acronym for the Law Enforcement Automated Data System police departments used to check for outstanding warrants and BOLO, cop speak for Be on the Lookout.<br><br>&#x201c;Roger that.&#x201d; Computer keys clicked. &#x201c;Be careful, will you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You got that right.&#x201d; <br><br>Anxious to get to the scene, Skid approached the Amish man. &#x201c;Turn around and put your hands against the car, partner.&#x201d;<br><br>Zimmerman looked bewildered. &#x201c;I did not do anything wrong.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s procedure. I&#x2019;m going to pat your down. The handcuffs are for your protection and mine. All right?&#x201d;<br><br>As if realizing he didn&#x2019;t have a choice, Zimmerman turned and set his hands against the cruiser. Quickly, Skid ran his hands over the man, checking pockets, socks, even his crotch. Then he snapped the cuffs into place. &#x201c;What are you doing here at this time of night?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I help with the milking. Work begins at 4 A.M.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And I thought I had bad hours.&#x201d;<br><br>The Amish man blinked.<br><br>&#x201c;Never mind.&#x201d; Opening the cruiser door, Skid ushered him into the back seat. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d;<br><br>Sliding behind the wheel, he put the cruiser in gear and started toward the house. In the rear view mirror, dust billowed in the red glow of the taillights. Ahead, a massive barn and silo stood in silhouette against the pre-dawn sky. The postcard perfect farm was the last place Skid expected any kind of trouble. He&#x2019;d lived in Painters Mill for going on four years now. Aside from a few minor infractions&#x2014;like that time two teenaged boys got caught racing their buggies down Main Street&#x2014;the Amish were damn near perfect citizens.

It's a place with soaring mountains, giant trees, glow-in-the-dark seawater, and stupendous slugs.<br><br>This area is called the Pacific Northwest, or Cascadia, and includes Washington, Oregon, and the<br> Alaska Panhandle in the United States, and British Columbia in Canada.<br><br>Whatever you call it, if you're lucky enough to live there or visit it, there's a lot of spectacular nature to discover. Whether you're in the woods, at the beach, by a stream or a swamp, or in your own backyard, there's plenty to find.<br><br>So go outside and discover what's there. This book will help you begin.<br><br> <b>Here's what you'll need to do to get started:</b><br><br>1. Use your senses. The more you stay still and quiet and examine what is around you, the more you&#x2019;ll find. Amazing animals could be nearby, but if you don't take the time to wait and watch, you might never find them. Listen, smell, and touch as you go.<br><br>2. Stay comfortable. It's hard to enjoy nature and discover new things when your feet hurt; you're cold, hungry, or thirsty; or you&#x2019;re worried about sliming your best outfit. Wear comfortable shoes and sturdy clothes. Dress for the weather, whether it's hot, cold, rainy, or all three. Be ready to change your clothing with the weather. If you're going on a longer hike, bring food, water, and a first aid kit.<br><br>3. Take care of nature. When you're done exploring, leave everything as you found it.<br><br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Put back rocks and logs you moved. Animals rely on them for shelter.<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pick up litter, even if it isn't yours.<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collecting a few leaves, sticks, rocks, or shells is fine, but leave living things where they are<br> �&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Don't feed wildlife.<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don&#x2019;t break plants.<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obey the rules of the trail. <br><br> 4. Stay safe. <br><br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don&#x2019;t go out alone. It&#x2019;s fun to explore with a friend, a sibling, or an adult. <br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you go on an expedition, get permission and share your plans with a responsible adult.

Online) memoir, Jodie Sweetin, once Danny Tanner&#x2019;s bubbly daughter on America&#x2019;s favorite family sitcom, takes readers behind the scenes of <i>Full House </i>and into her terrifying&#x2014;and uplifting&#x2014;real-life story of addiction and recovery.<br><br>How rude!<br> <br> Jodie Sweetin melted our hearts and made us laugh for eight years as cherub-faced, goody-two-shoes middle child Stephanie Tanner. Her ups and downs seemed not so different from our own, but more than a decade after the popular television show ended, the star publicly revealed her shocking recovery from methamphetamine addiction. Even then, she kept a painful secret&#x2014;one that could not be solved in thirty minutes with a hug, a stern talking-to, or a bowl of ice cream around the family table. The harrowing battle she swore she had won was really just beginning.<br> <br> In this deeply personal, utterly raw, and ultimately inspiring memoir, Jodie comes clean about the double life she led&#x2014;the crippling identity crisis, the hidden anguish of juggling a regular childhood with her Hollywood life, and the vicious cycle of abuse and recovery that led to a relapse even as she wrote this book. Finally, becoming a mother gave her the determination and the courage to get sober. With resilience, charm, and humor, she writes candidly about taking each day at a time. Hers is not a story of success or defeat, but of facing your demons, finding yourself, and telling the whole truth&#x2014;<i>unSweetined</i>.</p><p><b>Jodie Sweetin</b> is best known for her role as Stephanie Tanner on ABC's long-running, hugely popular sitcom <i>Full House</i>, which still airs in syndication. She has shared her story on <i>Good Morning America</i>, Idea<i>The Big&nbsp; with Donnie Deutsch</i>, <i>Access Hollywood</i>, <i>Entertainment Tonight</i>, and <i>Chelsea Lately</i>, and hosted <i>Pants-Off Dance-Off</i> on Fuse. She lives in California with her daughter, Zoie.UnSweetined chapter one<br><b>SPEECH IMPEDIMENT</b><p></p> <br>fuck it.<br> <br>I was tired of trying. Tired of controlling myself. Tired of caring.<br> <br>It was a Sunday night and my options were to sit home and get some rest for the big day I had on Monday or to go out, party, and not worry about anything. So when a friend called and asked me if I wanted to head to Hermosa Beach, I didn&#x2019;t hesitate.<br> <br>Before I knew it I was smoking meth and doing my hair, preparing for a big night. I drove off solo with my to-go cup filled with alcohol. I never went anywhere without my to-go cup.<br> <br>It was a typical night of partying. I met some people at a bar in Hermosa Beach that played house music on Sundays from 2:00 p.m. until around 2:00 a.m. I was friendly with the bar&#x2019;s owner so there was always a table waiting for me, and half-priced bottles for being such a good customer.<br> <br>From the second I walked in, it was on. Some friend gave me a hug and put Ecstasy right in my mouth. That&#x2019;s how the night started. Simple as that.<br> <br>Coke. No problem. We were doing it right at the table. Meth wasn&#x2019;t as socially acceptable so I did that at home, alone, or with a couple friends who were also using. But the coke, the Ecstasy&#x2014;the party&#x2014;went until closing. It almost always did.<br> <br>Then it was back to my place in Westchester, a Los Angeles neighborhood around the corner from LAX. It was always back to my place. Somehow the group had grown to about fifteen or twenty people. I was playing the role of after-party host. Looking back, I think I liked the control. I was always the driver, the host; it was always my show. With people waiting to party, I went into the kitchen and returned with a bottle of Jack Daniel&#x2019;s in one hand, a bottle of champagne under my arm, and a big plate of coke in the other hand for all of my guests. The crowd went wild. Standing ovation. Just how I liked it.<br> <br>As usual the party continued into the near-daylight hours. There was still a plate of coke on the living-room table and a handful of friends&#x2014;and I use that term loosely&#x2014;were making themselves at home.<br> <br>The only problem? In seven hours I would be standing in front of a roomful of college students at Marquette University telling them how great it felt to overcome a drug addiction and how important it was to stay off drugs. I had a flight to catch and needed to be at the airport by 5:30 a.m., and at a quarter to five, I was still nose-deep in a pile of cocaine with a roomful of strangers listening to house music. And I hadn&#x2019;t even packed!<br> <br>I was pretty good at pulling off this kind of thing. All my life I had given everyone exactly what they wanted. If <i>Full House</i> producers needed someone to look cute while eating Oat Boats, I smiled in my cereal. If my friends needed a house to party in, I opened my doors, supplied drugs, and broke up lines of cocaine with a credit card. And if America decided I was supposed to be a role model, I hopped on a plane, turned on my best Stephanie-Tanner-all-grown-up face-and gave a speech.<br> <br>So at 5:00 a.m. I threw some clothes in a bag, probably forgetting socks or toothpaste or something important, and attempted to make a clean escape. But the night of partying really left me frazzled. I came into the living room with my packed bag in hand and started shaking. I couldn&#x2019;t speak. I couldn&#x2019;t think. I had been up for two days straight, partying without a care in the world, and now I was starting to lose it.<br> <br>On the car ride I realized I was wearing a T-shirt that said &#x201c;Things you shouldn&#x2019;t take to the airport&#x201d; with pictures of drugs, guns, and a toothpaste tube larger than three ounces. I was one for three; I was carrying a bag of cocaine because I knew I couldn&#x2019;t get through the next twenty-four hours without it&#x2014;and praying the stupid shirt didn&#x2019;t give me away to the airport security guard. That sort of paranoia comes along with drug use. <i>The guard searching my bag will not see the humor in my T-shirt and will look extra hard through my bags. Oh my God! What am I going to do?</i><br> <br>He did search pretty hard, but not because of the shirt. I took a deep breath and attempted to remain cool as the guard rummaged through my belongings. My friend who drove me to the airport told me I probably shouldn&#x2019;t talk to anybody because at that point I couldn&#x2019;t put together a complete sentence. The security guy took out my cosmetic case and asked me about every item. It took every ounce of energy I had to get out the words &#x201c;lip gloss&#x201d; and &#x201c;mascara&#x201d; without looking like a complete wreck. But I was dying inside. I thought this was it. I was going to get busted. How could I not? The guard then pulled out the compact where I kept my coke. My heart was beating through my chest. I thought for sure I was going to be arrested. And then it happened ...<br> <br>&#x201c;OK, ma&#x2019;am, have a nice flight.&#x201d;<br> <br>I was safe.<br> <br>I sat down at the gate and nearly broke down. What am I doing? What the hell is wrong with me? How did I become this person?<br> <br>If I had had that gun my shirt warned against, I probably would have blown my brains out. I was miserable ...and exhausted.<br> <br>When I got to my hotel near Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, I slept for a few hours but when I woke up I was still dead tired. I was a mess. Luckily I had the coke to pick me back up. I did a few key bumps and headed to the lecture hall, where a sold-out crowd waited to hear me speak. I thought for sure that one of the professors would take one look at me and kick me out. But none did. They wanted to hear about the trials and tribulations of Jodie Sweetin, or at least the Jodie Sweetin I had created by appearing on <i>Good Morning America</i> and talking to <i>People</i> magazine.<br> <br>I stood up at the podium, looked around the room, and put on my best TV smile. I was so disappointed in myself. I was living a complete lie. But unfortunately, guilt doesn&#x2019;t make you stop. I talked about growing up on television and about how great my life was now that I was sober, and then midspeech I started to cry. The crowd probably thought that the memories of hitting rock bottom were too much for me to handle. Or maybe they thought the tears were just a way for an actor to send a message that drugs are bad. I don&#x2019;t know what they thought.<br> <br>I know what they didn&#x2019;t think. They didn&#x2019;t think I was coming down from a two-day bender of coke, meth, and Ecstasy and they didn&#x2019;t think that I was lying to them with every sentence that came out of my mouth. That much I do know. The little bit of coke that I had done before the speech wasn&#x2019;t enough to make me forget how bad I felt for doing what I was doing. The guilt was eating away at me. I was struggling to keep it together, but no one realized that. I finished. They applauded. Standing ovation. Just how I liked it. And it was over.<br> <br>I was just so tired. Tired of lying. Tired of pretending to be someone that I wasn&#x2019;t. I took a deep breath and walked out of the lecture hall. I went back to my hotel room and buried my face in my hands. I couldn&#x2019;t keep doing this. It had to end.<br> <br>But not today. I wiped away the tears and finished the baggie of coke.<br> <br>Fuck it. I&#x2019;ll quit tomorrow.<br> <br>It had been a year since I went on <i>Good Morning America</i> and told the world that I was a recovered drug addict. And back then I really was recovering&#x2014;or trying to, anyway. I had been sober for a few months, but I knew in the back of my mind it wasn&#x2019;t over. I wasn&#x2019;t ready.<br> <br>But the story was a good one and it landed me the speaking jobs I needed to keep my career going and the drug money rolling in. Drugs and alcohol don&#x2019;t come cheap&#x2014;especially when you are also buying for a group of friends who mooch off your residual checks. I didn&#x2019;t put up with eight seasons of Kimmy Gibbler so <i>they</i> could get high!<br> <br>With the new income and a new house in Los Angeles it was all too easy to get right back into drugs.<br> <br>It started one day, just a few months after my <i>GMA</i> spot, when I got a random phone call from a friend who I used with and who occasionally sold me drugs. I invited her to my place. I was in an apartment at the time. I knew it was a really bad idea to invite her over but I wanted to test myself, I guess. We hung out, played cards. I told her I hadn&#x2019;t done meth in a while. One thing led to another and just like that, I was back.<br> <br>After trying to stay sober and then relapsing a number of times, battling the decision to remain sober for a couple of months, I began to give up on myself. Then, when I moved into the house, I stopped putting in the effort altogether. &#x201c;You can do this again,&#x201d; I told myself about using. I wasn&#x2019;t in a relationship and I didn&#x2019;t have a good group of friends around me. I was frustrated and tired of trying. I had it in my head that I just wasn&#x2019;t done.<br> <br>I was always up for any party, especially if it involved Las Vegas, but my newfound careless attitude often got in my way. I regularly lost cell phones, wallets, and other valuables. One weekend, everyone decided to head out to Vegas, but before I could leave, I had to get cash from the bank since I had misplaced my ATM card. I took out ten thousand dollars in cash to bring with me to bankroll the alcohol and drugs for everyone, as usual, and a little shopping for me.<br> <br>In Sin City I spent two thousand dollars on makeup and an outfit for the evening and was ready to have fun. The night brought us to various clubs and then to a blowout back at the hotel. Random people made their way in and out of my party until the sun came up. The next morning I noticed that the remaining eight thousand dollars was gone. Maybe I lost it, or maybe it was stolen. I didn&#x2019;t care.<br> <br>Whether in Vegas or in Hollywood, people would call and ask if I had plans, and even when I had had no intention of going out, I would say, &#x201c;yeah sure&#x201d; and it would be off to a night on the town. Outside of the speeches, I didn&#x2019;t have any responsibilities so I often blew off my family and sober friends and opted to hang out with whoever wanted to do drugs.<br> <br>Quickly, I was back to partying like I was at my worst, spending seven hundred dollars a week on meth, coke, and Ecstasy and another four to five thousand dollars every week or two on table service at various Hollywood hot spots. After partying, I&#x2019;d head to random colleges and give speeches that were packed with lies. If during the Q &amp; A portion someone asked me how long I had been sober, I&#x2019;d say I had gotten out of rehab in April 2005, and out of sober living in October that same year. That part was true&#x2014;but I was covering up my relapses. I felt terrible about what I was doing. I thought that maybe, if I kept getting up there, giving these talks, and saying I was sober enough that eventually it would happen for me: The story I was telling, with the happy ending I was creating, would somehow come true.<br> <br>But even with my life as messy as it was, I hadn&#x2019;t really hit rock bottom yet. I was too strong to hit that sort of low. I wasn&#x2019;t going to overdose, wind up in the hospital, or have any near-death scares like I did the first time around. I was too in control.<br> <br>It was a far cry from the cute little girl that everyone remembered from <i>Full House</i>&#x2014;the girl everyone expected me to be for the rest of my life. I wasn&#x2019;t Stephanie Tanner or the girl I was pretending to be in speeches and interviews, but I wasn&#x2019;t exactly the drug addict, wild child that my friends thought I was either. I didn&#x2019;t know who I was. That was the problem that may have led to my drug use in the first place, a problem that goes back as far as I can remember. ...</p><h2>The 12 Days of Christmas: The Story Behind a Favorite Christmas Song</h2><p>Discover the Christian symbolism in the classic Christmas carol, &#x201c;The 12 Days of Christmas.&#x201d; Explore this beautifully illustrated classic carol and the meaning behind the twelve days between Christmas and Epiphany (January 6th).

It&#x2019;s a list of the most <i>significant</i> foods culturally and historically to the Jewish people, explored deeply with essays, recipes, stories, and context. Some of the dishes are no longer cooked at home, and some are not even dishes in the traditional sense (store-bought cereal and Stella D&#x2019;oro cookies, for example). The entire list is up for debate, which is what makes this book so much fun. Many of the foods are delicious (such as babka and shakshuka). Others make us wonder how they&#x2019;ve survived as long as they have (such as unhatched chicken eggs and jellied calves&#x2019; feet). As expected, many Jewish (and now universal) favorites like matzo balls, pickles, cheesecake, blintzes, and chopped liver make the list. The recipes are global and represent all contingencies of the Jewish experience. Contributors include Ruth Reichl, �ric Ripert, Joan Nathan, Michael Solomonov, Dan Barber, Gail Simmons, Yotam Ottolenghi, Tom Colicchio, Amanda Hesser and Merrill Stubbs, Maira Kalman, Action Bronson, Daphne Merkin, Shalom Auslander, Dr. Ruth Westheimer, and Phil Rosenthal, among many others.

It emerged in America in the 1940s, with lead protagonists including Jackson Pollock, Philip Guston, Robert Motherwell, Mark Rothko, and Willem de Kooning. </p><p>Abstract Expressionism spawned many different stylistic tendencies but two particularly prominent sub-categories: action painting, exemplified by de Kooning and Pollock, and color field painting, made most famous by Rothko. Throughout, Abstract Expressionists strove to convey emotions and ideas through the making of marks, through forms, textures, shades, and the particular quality of brushstrokes. The movement favored large-scale canvases, and embraced the role of accident or chance.</p><p>With featured works from 20 key Abstract Expressionist artists, this book introduces the movement which shifted the center of art gravity from Paris to New York and remains for many the golden moment of American art.</p></p><p>Barbara Hess (b. 1964) is an art historian, critic, and translator and resides in Cologne.

Suddenly Clarkston&#x2019;s streets were filled with women wearing the hijab, the smells of cumin and curry, and kids of all colors playing soccer in any open space they could find. The town also became home to Luma Mufleh, an American-educated Jordanian woman who founded a youth soccer team to unify Clarkston&#x2019;s refugee children and keep them off the streets. These kids named themselves the Fugees.<br><br>Set against the backdrop of an American town that without its consent had become a vast social experiment, Outcasts United follows a pivotal season in the life of the Fugees and their charismatic coach. Warren St. John documents the lives of a diverse group of young people as they miraculously coalesce into a band of brothers, while also drawing a fascinating portrait of a fading American town struggling to accommodate its new arrivals. At the center of the story is fiery Coach Luma, who relentlessly drives her players to success on the soccer field while holding together their lives&#x2014;and the lives of their families&#x2014;in the face of a series of daunting challenges.<br><br>This fast-paced chronicle of a single season is a complex and inspiring tale of a small town becoming a global community&#x2014;and an account of the ingenious and complicated ways we create a home in a changing world.</p><p>Warren St. John is a reporter for <i>The New York Times</i> and the author of the national bestseller <i>Rammer Jammer Yellow Hammer</i>.<i>Chapter One<br><br>Luma<br></i><br>The name Luma means &#x201c;dark lips,&#x201d; though Hassan and Sawsan al-Mufleh chose it for their first child less because of the shade of her lips than because they liked the sound of the name&#x2013;short, endearing, and cheerful&#x2013;in the context of both Arabic and English. The al-Mufl ehs were a wealthy, Westernized family in Amman, Jordan, a teeming city of two million, set among nineteen hills and cooled by a swirl of dry desert breezes. The family made its fortune primarily from making rebar&#x2013;the metal rods used to strengthen concrete&#x2013;which it sold across Jordan. Hassan had attended a Quaker school in Lebanon, and then college in the United States at the State University of New York in Oswego&#x2013;&#x201c;the same college as Jerry Seinfeld,&#x201d; he liked to tell people.<br><br>Luma&#x2019;s mother, Sawsan, was emotional and direct, and there was never any doubt about her mood or feelings. Luma, though, took after her father, Hassan, a man who mixed unassailable toughness with a capacity to detach, a combination that seemed designed to keep his emotions hidden for fear of revealing weakness.<br><br>&#x201c;My sister and my dad don&#x2019;t like people going into them and knowing who they are,&#x201d; said Inam al-Mufl eh, Luma&#x2019;s younger sister byeleven years and now a researcher for the Jordanian army in Amman.<br><br>&#x201c;Luma&#x2019;s very sensitive but she never shows it. She doesn&#x2019;t want anyone to know where her soft spot is.&#x201d;<br><br>As a child, Luma was doted on by her family, sometimes to an extraordinary degree. At the age of three, Luma idly mentioned to her grandmother that she thought her grandparents&#x2019; new Mercedes 450 SL was &#x201c;beautiful.&#x201d; The next day, the grandparents&#x2019; driver showed up at Hassan and Sawsan al-Mufl eh&#x2019;s home with a gift: a set of keys to the Mercedes, which, they were told, now belonged to their threeyear-old daughter.<br><br>Hassan too doted on his eldest child. He had high expectations for her, and imagined her growing up to fulfi ll the prescribed role of a woman in a prominent Jordanian family. He expected her to marry, to stay close to home, and to honor her family.<br><br>From the time Luma was just a young girl, adults around her began to note her quiet confi dence, which was so pronounced that her parents occasionally found themselves at a loss.<br><br>&#x201c;When we would go to the PTA meetings,&#x201d; Hassan recalled, &#x201c;they&#x2019;d ask me, &#x2018;Why are you asking about Luma? She doesn&#x2019;t need your help.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Sometimes, Luma&#x2019;s parents found themselves striving to please their confi dent daughter, rather than the other way around. Hassan recalled that on a family vacation to Spain when Luma was ten or eleven years old, he had ordered a glass of sangria over dinner, in violation of the Muslim prohibition against drinking alcohol. When the drink arrived, Luma began to sob uncontrollably.<br><br>&#x201c;She said, &#x2018;I love my father too much&#x2013;I don&#x2019;t want him to go to hell,&#x2019; &#x201d; Hassan recalled. He asked the waitress to take the sangria away.<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t drink after that,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Luma encouraged&#x2013;or perhaps demanded&#x2013;that her younger sister, Inam, cultivate self-suffi ciency, often against Inam&#x2019;s own instincts or wishes.<br><br>&#x201c;She was a tough older sister&#x2013;very tough love,&#x201d; Inam said. &#x201c;She would make me do things that I didn&#x2019;t want to do. She never wanted me to take the easy way out. And she wouldn&#x2019;t accept me crying.&#x201d;<br><br>Inam said that she has a particularly vivid memory of her older sister&#x2019;s tough love in action. The al-Mufl ehs had gathered with their cousins, as they often did on weekends, at the family farm in a rural area called Mahes, half an hour from Amman. Inam, who was just seven or eight at the time, said that Luma took her and a group of young cousins out to a dirt road to get some exercise. The kids set off jogging, with Luma trailing them in the family Range Rover. It was hot and dry and hilly, and one by one, the kids began to complain. But Luma wouldn&#x2019;t have any of it. She insisted that they keep running.<br><br>&#x201c;She was in the car, and we were running like crazy,&#x201d; Inam recalled. &#x201c;Everyone was crying. And if I would cry, she would just look at me.&#x201d;<br><br>That withering look, which Luma would perfect over the years, had the stinging effect of a riding crop. Despite the pain, little Inam kept running.<br><br>Luma&#x2019;s drill-sergeant routine at Mahes became a kind of family legend, recalled to rib Hassan and Sawsan&#x2019;s firstborn for her tough exterior. The family knew another side of Luma&#x2013;one that others rarely encountered&#x2013;that of a sensitive, even sentimental young woman with a deep concern for those she perceived to be weak or defenseless. Luma laughed along with everyone else. She enjoyed a good joke and a well-earned teasing, even at her own expense. But jokes aside, Luma&#x2019;s tough love had it&#x2019;s intended effect.<br><br>&#x201c;I wanted to prove to my sister that I could do anything,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I always remember that my sister pushed me and I found out I was able to do it.&#x201d;<br><br>THE AL-MUFLEHS WERE intent on raising their children with their same cosmopolitan values. They sent Luma to the American Community School in Amman, a school for the children of American expatriates, mostly diplomats and businessmen, and elite Jordanians, including the children of King Hussein and Queen Noor. Luma learned to speak English without an accent&#x2013;she now speaks like a midwesterner&#x2013;and met kids from the United States and Europe, as well as the children of diplomats from all over the world.<br><br>Luma&#x2019;s childhood was idyllic by most measures, and certainly by comparison to those of most in Jordan. She went to the best school in Amman and lived at a comfortable distance from the problems of that city, including poverty and the tensions brought on by the infl ux of Palestinian and later Iraqi refugees. But her maternal grandmother, Munawar, made a point of acknowledging and aiding the poor whenever she could. Beggars regularly knocked on her door because they knew that on principle she would always give them alms. And when relatives would tell her she was being taken advantage of because of her generosity, Munawar would brush them off.<br><br>&#x201c;She would say we had an obligation because we were so privileged,&#x201d; Luma recalled. &#x201c;And she would say, &#x2018;God judges them, not us.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Munawar&#x2019;s home abutted a lot in Amman where young men played soccer in the afternoons. As a kid, Luma would climb a grapevine on the concrete wall behind the house and watch the men play. She eventuallygot the nerve to join in, and she would play until her grandmother saw her and ordered her inside on the grounds that it was improper for a young woman to be around strange men.<br><br>&#x201c;She would have a fi t if she saw me playing soccer with men,&#x201d; Luma said. &#x201c;And then she&#x2019;d say, &#x2018;We are not going to tell your father about this.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>At the American Community School, Luma was free from the strictures of a conservative Muslim society and at liberty to play sports as boys did. She played basketball, volleyball, soccer, and baseball with the same intensity, and stood out to her coaches, particularly an African American woman named Rhonda Brown.<br><br>&#x201c;She was keen to learn,&#x201d; Brown said. &#x201c;And no matter what you asked her to do, she did it without questioning why.&#x201d; Brown, the wife of an American diplomat at the U.S. embassy in Amman, coached volleyball. She had played volleyball in college at Miami University in Ohio and, when she found herself bored in the role of a diplomat&#x2019;s wife, had volunteered to coach the women&#x2019;s varsity volleyball team at the ACS. When she showed up to coach, Brown said, she was disappointed at what she found.<br>&#x201c;These girls were lazy&#x2013;incredibly lazy,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>Luma was the notable exception. Though Brown didn&#x2019;t know much about the Jordanian girl, she noticed her dedication right away and felt she was the kind of player a team could be built around. Coach Brown asked a lot of her players, and especially of Luma. She expected them to be on time to practice, to work hard, to focus, and to improve. She believed in running&#x2013;lots of running&#x2013;and drilling to the point of exhaustion. Brown challenged her players by setting an example herself. She was always on time. She was organized. When she asked her players to run fi ve kilometers, she joined them, but with a challenge: &#x201c;Because you&#x2019;re younger I expect you to do it better than me,&#x201d; she told them. &#x201c;If I beat you, you can expect the worst practices ever.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They ran,&#x201d; Brown said.<br><br>Brown&#x2019;s coaching philosophy was built on the belief that young people craved leadership and structure and at the same time were capable of taking on a tremendous amount of responsibility. She didn&#x2019;t believe in coddling.<br><br>&#x201c;My feeling is that kids have to have rules,&#x201d; Brown explained. &#x201c;They have to know what the boundaries are. And kids want to know what their limits are. It&#x2019;s important for them to know that people have expectations of them.&#x201d;<br><br>Brown was resigned to the fact that her players might not like her at fi rst. But she took a long view toward their development and their trust in her. She was willing to wait out the hostility until her players broke through.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m stubborn,&#x201d; Brown said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t give in a lot. You can come across as mean, and until they see what kind of person you are they might not like you.&#x201d;<br><br>In fact, Luma didn&#x2019;t like Brown at all. She felt singled out for extra work and didn&#x2019;t appreciate all the extra running. But she kept her mouth shut and didn&#x2019;t complain, partly, she said, out of a suspicion that she and her teammates would benefi t from the harsh treatment.<br><br>&#x201c;I knew my teammates were lazy&#x2013;talented but lazy,&#x201d; Luma said.<br><br>&#x201c;And part of me was like, Maybe I want the challenge. Maybe these very harsh, very tough practices will work.&#x201d;<br><br>Over time, the practices began to have an effect. The team improved. They were motivated, and even the slackers on the team began working hard. Along the way, Luma started to pick up on a seeming contradiction. Though she told herself she disliked Coach Brown, she wanted desperately to play well for her. &#x201c;For the majority of the time she coached me, I hated her,&#x201d; Luma said. &#x201c;But she had our respect. She didn&#x2019;t ask us to do anything she wouldn&#x2019;t do. Until then I&#x2019;d always played for me. I&#x2019;d never played for a coach.&#x201d;<br><br>When Luma was in high school and still playing for Coach Brown the junior varsity girls&#x2019; soccer team at the American Community School found itself in need of a coach. Luma volunteered. She emulated Brown&#x2013;putting the team through fi ve days a week of running drills and pushing the young women to work harder and to get better.<br><br>Luma loved it. She liked the way the daily problems of the world seemed to recede once she took the field, the subtle psychological strategies one had to employ to get the best out of each player, and most of all the sense of satisfaction that came from forging something new out of disparate elements: an entity with its distinct identity, not a collection of individuals, but a new being, a team. And she wasn&#x2019;t afraid to admit she also liked being in charge.<br><br>But as she got older and accustomed to the liberty she had as a woman at ACS&#x2013;where she could coach and play sports as she pleased&#x2013;she began to feel at odds with the Jordanian society in which she had grown up. She wanted to be able to play pickup games of soccer with whoever was around, without regard to gender. She wanted the liberty to be as assertive in her daily life as Coach Brown had taught her to be on the court. Her family&#x2019;s social status created additional pressure for her to follow a more traditional path. There were obligations, as well as the looming threat that she might be pressured into marrying someone she didn&#x2019;t love.<br><br>&#x201c;When you come from a family that&#x2019;s prominent, there are expectations of you,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And I hated that. It&#x2019;s a very patriarchal society, and as modern as it is, women are still second-class citizens. I didn&#x2019;t want to be treated that way.&#x201d;<br><br>Coach Brown picked up on Luma&#x2019;s yearning. At a team sleepover, the players and coach went around the room predicting where everyone would be in ten years. Coach Brown joked that Luma would be &#x201c;living illegally in the United States.&#x201d; Everyone laughed, including Luma. But she disagreed.<br><br>&#x201c;In ten years, I&#x2019;ll be there legally,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;I knew from even our brief time together that she wanted something else for her life,&#x201d; Brown recalled.<br><br>Toward the end of Luma&#x2019;s junior year, she and her parents decided she would attend college in the United States. Hassan and Sawsan wanted their daughter to continue her Western education, a rite of sorts for well-to-do Jordanians. But Luma was more interested in life in the United States than she was in what an education there might do for her in Jordan. &#x201c;America was the land of opportunity,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It was a very appealing dream of what you want your life to be like.&#x201d; Within the family, Luma&#x2019;s grandmother alone seemed to understand the implications of her going to college in the United States.<br><br>&#x201c;If she moves to America,&#x201d; Munawar told the family, &#x201c;there&#x2019;s a chance she won&#x2019;t come back.&#x201d; <br><br>Luma&#x2019;s fi rst trip to the United States came when she enrolled at Hobart and William Smith College, a coed school in the Finger Lakes region of New York, not too far from where her father had gone to college. She played soccer her first fall there, but midway through the season injured a knee, sidelining her for the rest of the year. Luma liked the school well enough, but winter there was colder than anything she had experienced in Amman, and the campus was remote. She wondered if she had made the right choice in going so far from home. Luma decided to look at other schools, and soon visited Smith College, the women&#x2019;s school in Northampton, Massachusetts.<br><br>The campus seemed to perfectly embody the setting Luma had envisioned for herself when she left Jordan for America. It was set in a picturesque New England town with a strong sense of community and security. And as a women&#x2019;s college, Smith was focused on imbuing its students with the very sort of self-reliance and self-confidence Luma felt she had been deprived of at home. Luma fell in love with the place and transferred for her sophomore year.<br><br>At Smith, Luma had what she described as a kind of awakening. She was taken by the presence of so many self-confident, achieving women, and also by the social mobility she saw evident in the student body. Her housemate, for example, was the first in her family to go to college, and there she was at one of the preeminent private colleges in the United States. That would never happen in Jordan, Luma remembered thinking to herself at the time.<br><br>Luma&#x2019;s friends at Smith remember her as outgoing and involved&#x2013;in intramural soccer and in social events sponsored by the college&#x2019;s house system. Few understood her background; she spoke English so well that other students she met assumed she was American.<br><br>&#x201c;One day we were hanging out talking about our childhoods and she said, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m from Jordan,&#x2019; &#x201d; recalled Misty Wyman, a student from Maine who would become Luma&#x2019;s best friend. &#x201c;I thought she&#x2019;d been born to American parents overseas. It had never occurred to me that she was Jordanian.&#x201d;<br><br>On a trip home to Jordan after her junior year at Smith, Luma realized that she could never feel comfortable living there. Jordan, while a modern Middle Eastern state, was not an easy place for a woman used to Western freedoms. Professional opportunities for women were limited. Under Sharia law, which applied to domestic and inheritance matters, the testimony of two women carried the weight of that from a single man. A wife had to obtain permission from her husband simply to apply for a passport. And so-called honor killings were still viewed leniently in Sharia courts. As a member of a well-known family, Luma felt monitored and pressured to follow a pres...</p><h2>The Pleasures of the Damned: Poems, 1951-1993</h2><p><p> To his legions of fans, Charles Bukowski was&#x2014;and remains&#x2014;the quintessential counterculture icon. A hard-drinking wild man of literature and a stubborn outsider to the poetry world, he wrote unflinchingly about booze, work, and women, in raw, street-tough poems whose truth has struck a chord with generations of readers. </p> <p> Edited by John Martin, the legendary publisher of Black Sparrow Press and a close friend of Bukowski's, <i>The Pleasures of the Damned</i> is a selection of the best works from Bukowski's long poetic career, including the last of his never-before-collected poems. Celebrating the full range of the poet's extra-ordinary and surprising sensibility, and his uncompromising linguistic brilliance, these poems cover a rich lifetime of experiences and speak to Bukowski's "immense intelligence, the caring heart that saw through the sham of our pretenses and had pity on our human condition" (<i>The New York Quarterly</i>). <i>The Pleasures of the Damned</i> is an astonishing poetic treasure trove, essential reading for both longtime fans and those just discovering this unique and legendary American voice. </p></p><p><p><strong>Charles Bukowski</strong>&nbsp;is one of America&#x2019;s best-known contemporary writers of poetry and prose and, many would claim, its most influential and imitated poet. He was born in 1920 in Andernach, Germany, to an American soldier father and a German mother, and brought to the United States at the age of two. He was raised in Los Angeles and lived there for over fifty years. He died in San Pedro, California, on March 9, 1994, at the age of seventy-three, shortly after completing his last novel,&nbsp;<em>Pulp</em>.</p><p><strong>Abel Debritto</strong>, a former Fulbright scholar and current Marie Curie fellow, works in the digital humanities. He is the author of&nbsp;<em>Charles Bukowski, King of the Underground</em>, and the editor of the Bukowski collections&nbsp;<em>On Writing</em>,&nbsp;<em>On Cats</em>, and&nbsp;<em>On Love</em>.</p><p>Reviewed by Bill Press</p><p>Even though he was preoccupied with his own death, Charles Bukowski worried about one thing even more: "of course, I may die in the next ten minutes/ and I'm ready for that/ but what I'm really worried about is/ that my editor-publisher might retire/ even though he is ten years younger than/ I." </p><p>Bukowski needn't have worried. John Martin not only outlived him, he's still at it: hunting down uncollected poems, editing Bukowski, and turning out yet new volumes of one of America's most-published poets. After convincing Bukowski to quit the post office and write for a living, Martin and his Black Sparrow Press became the poet's sole publisher. Since closing Black Sparrow in 2002, Martin has produced for Ecco five collections of poems that Bukowski set aside to be published posthumously. For this sixth and last volume, he reviewed all 2,618 poems in the 21 Bukowski books that Ecco now has in print and selected 273 of what he told me were "the best of the best of Bukowski," including 20 poems never before collected.</p><p>In a very real sense, then, The Pleasures of the Damned is as much about John Martin as it is about Charles Bukowski. It's an insightful walk through the work of a poet by the man who knew him best, and it reveals Bukowski in the many, often conflicting dimensions that make him such a popular, accessible, and, yes, great artist. Others might write for the high-brow, Bukowski writes for the crowd. Others see poetry in a flower or symphony, Bukowski sees poetry in whores standing on a street corner, a man mowing his lawn or boxcars sitting in a railroad yard. For him, as for Walt Whitman, poetry is everyday life: "a poem is a city, a poem is a nation,/ a poem is the world. . . ." </p><p>This extraordinary collection establishes Bukowski as much more than just another West Coast Beat poet. At last, maybe fans like me won't have to apologize for ranking him among the best.</p><p>There are many sides to Bukowski, and here they are all on full display. He's at once cynical about humankind, yet full of hope. His language can be uncomfortably crude, yet movingly lyrical. He shocks you on one page and moves you on the next. Nowhere is he more seemingly contradictory than in his complex relationships with women. Just when you think he sees women as nothing but a collection of body parts, he unveils an amazing tenderness. After his graphic description of showering with his wife, Linda, for example -- "I turn her, kiss her,/ soap up the breasts, get them and the belly, the neck,/ the fronts of the legs, the ankles, the feet,/ and then the . . . " -- he suddenly admits his fear of losing her: "Linda, you brought it to me/ when you take it away/ do it slowly and easily/ make it as if I were dying in my sleep instead of in/ my life, amen." </p><p>Indeed, the impression of Bukowski from this collection is that of a crude, hard-living, hard-drinking, hard-fighting curmudgeon who is, at the same time, a closet romantic. In "The Bluebird," perhaps the most beautiful and revealing of all his poems, Bukowski hints that his rough exterior, first mounted as a protective shield against an abusive father, is just a smokescreen to mask the vulnerable soul lurking inside: "there's a bluebird in my heart that/ wants to get out/ but I'm too tough for him."</p><p>What's surprising about The Pleasures of the Damned is that, while Bukowski died of leukemia in 1994, many poems in this collection read as though they were expressly written for today. He has great faith in democracy, but no patience with those who complain about the political process: "fellow citizens/ the problem never was the Democratic/ System, the problem is// you." He skewers politicians who preach one thing but practice just the opposite: "AND The Best at Hate Are Those/ Who Preach LOVE/ AND THE BEST AT WAR/ -- FINALLY -- ARE THOSE WHO/ PREACH/ PEACE." And he recognizes the futility of war after war: "but the young wised up first/ and now the old are getting wise,/ almost everybody's anti-war,/ no use having a war you can't win,/ right or wrong." </p><p>Bukowski had little faith in his contemporaries. The older generation he dismissed as "the raving, the battered, the blind and the sadly corrupt." It's in the young that he placed his hope, and it's for them he saved some of his most powerful advice: "invent yourself and then reinvent yourself/ change your tone and shape so often that they can/ never/ categorize you." In some fashion, we must all survive the test that sums up Bukowski's remarkable life: "what matters most is/ how well you/ walk through the/ fire." </p><p></p><p><br>Copyright 2008, The Washington Post.

He lives in London, England.Prologue<br>An Invitation<br>Tuesday, October 1, 1946,<br>Nuremberg&#x2019;s Palace of Justice<br>&nbsp;<br>A little after three o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon, the wooden door behind the defendant&#x2019;s dock slid open and Hans Frank entered court- room 600. He wore a gray suit, a shade that was offset by the white helmets worn by the two somber-faced military guards, his escorts. The hearings had taken a toll on the man who had been Adolf Hitler&#x2019;s personal lawyer and then personal representative in German-occupied Poland, with his pink cheeks, sharp little nose, and sleeked-back hair. Frank was no longer the slender and swank minister celebrated by his friend Richard Strauss. Indeed, he was in a considerable state of perturbation, so much so that as he entered the room, he turned and faced the wrong direction, showing his back to the judges. <br><br>Sitting in the packed courtroom that day was the professor of international law at Cambridge University. Balding and bespectacled, Hersch Lauterpacht perched at the end of a long wooden table, round as an owl, flanked by distinguished colleagues on the British prosecution team. Seated no more than a few feet from Frank, in a trademark black suit, Lauterpacht was the one who came up with the idea of putting the term &#x201c;crimes against humanity&#x201d; into the Nuremberg statute, three words to describe the murder of four million Jews and Poles on the territory of Poland. Lauterpacht would come to be recognized as the finest international legal mind of the twen- tieth century and a father of the modern human rights movement, yet his interest in Frank was not just professional. For five years, Frank had been governor of a territory that included the city of Lemberg, where Lauterpacht had a large family, including his parents, a brother and sister, their children. When the trial had opened a year earlier, their fate in the kingdom of Hans Frank was unknown. <br><br>Another man with an interest in the trial was not there that day. Rafael Lemkin listened to the judgment on a wireless, from a bed in an American military hospital in Paris. A public prosecutor and then a lawyer in Warsaw, he fled Poland in 1939, when the war broke out, and eventually reached America. There he worked with the trial&#x2019;s American prosecution team, alongside the British. On that long journey, he carried a number of valises, each crammed with documents, among them many decrees signed by Frank. In studying these materials, Lemkin found a pattern of behavior, to which he gave a label, to describe the crime with which Frank could be charged. He called it &#x201c;genocide.&#x201d; Unlike Lauterpacht, with his focus on crimes against humanity, which aimed at the protection of individuals, he was more concerned with the protection of groups. He had worked tirelessly to get the crime of genocide into Frank&#x2019;s trial, but on this last day of the trial he was too unwell to attend. He too had a personal interest in Frank: he had spent years in Lw�w, and his parents and brother were caught up in the crimes said to have been committed on Frank&#x2019;s territory. <br><br>&#x201c;Defendant Hans Frank,&#x201d; the president of the tribunal announced. Frank was about to learn whether he would still be alive at Christmas, in a position to honor the promise he had recently made to his seven-year-old son, that all was fine and he would be home for the holiday. <br>&nbsp;<br>Thursday, October 16, 2014,<br>Nuremberg&#x2019;s Palace of Justice<br>&nbsp;<br>Sixty-eight years later I visited courtroom 600 in the company of Hans Frank&#x2019;s son Niklas, who was a small boy when that promise was made. <br><br>Niklas and I began our visit in the desolate, empty wing of the disused prison at the rear of the Palace of Justice, the only one of the four wings that still stood. We sat together in a small cell, like the one in which his father spent the better part of a year. The last time Niklas had been in this part of the building was in September 1946. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the only room in the world where I am a little bit nearer to my father,&#x201d; he told me, &#x201c;sitting here and thinking of being him, for about a year being in here, with an open toilet and a small table and a small bed and nothing else.&#x201d; The cell was unforgiving, and so was Niklas on the subject of his father&#x2019;s actions. &#x201c;My father was a lawyer; he knew what he did.&#x201d; <br><br>Courtroom 600, still a working courtroom, was not greatly changed since the time of the trial. Back in 1946, the route from the cells required each of the twenty-one defendants to travel up a small elevator that led directly to the courtroom, a contraption that Niklas and I were keen to see. It remained, behind the dock at which the defendants sat, entered through the same wooden door, which slid open as noiselessly as ever. &#x201c;Open, shut, open, shut,&#x201d; wrote R. W. Cooper of <i>The Times </i>of London, the former lawn tennis correspondent who reported each day on the trial. Niklas slid the door open and entered the small space, then closed the door behind him. <br><br>When he came back out, he made his way to the place where his father sat during the trial, charged with crimes against humanity and genocide. Niklas sat down and leaned forward on the wooden rail. He looked at me, then around the room, and then he sighed. I had often wondered about the last time his father passed through the elevator&#x2019;s sliding door and made his way to the defendant&#x2019;s dock. It was something to be imagined and not seen, because cameras were not allowed to film the last afternoon of the trial, on Tuesday, October 1, 1946. This was done to protect the dignity of the defendants. <br><br>Niklas interrupted my thoughts. He spoke gently and firmly. &#x201c;This is a happy room, for me, and for the world.&#x201d; <br><br><i>From the book EAST WEST STREET by Philippe Sands, copyright&nbsp;� 2016&nbsp;by Philippe Sands.

Rafe and the rest of the pack of "delinquent" trainees are forced to cooperate as they prepare for the final test: a solo excursion in the deep woods. Can Rafe come out of the experience in one piece? And if he does, will he go home as the same insecure kid?<br>Both heartwarming and hilarious, <i>Save Rafe!</i> is a story of perseverance and courage as only James Patterson could tell it.<br></p><p>James Patterson has had more <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers than any other writer, ever, according to <i>Guinness World Records</i>. Since his first novel won the Edgar Award in 1977 James Patterson's books have sold more than 300 million copies. He is the author of the Alex Cross novels<b>,</b> the most popular detective series of the past twenty-five years, including <i>Kiss the Girls </i>and <i>Along Came a Spider</i>. He writes full-time and lives in Florida with his family.<br>Gr 3&#x2013;7&#x2014;After learning that his art academy is closing, Rafe Khatchadorian learns that he will be headed back to the dreaded Hills Village Middle School in the fall. But first he has to survive The Program, an intensive one-week adventure for behaviorally challenged students. No problem, right? Rafe quickly realizes that running white water rapids, climbing a cliff, building fires, cooking in the wilderness, living through wild storms in a collapsing shelter, and wrangling crazy teammates may just be his biggest challenge yet. But Rafe is determined that this time he won't let his mother down. So, with some newfound determination and a lot of humor, Rafe conquers (or at least survives) one challenge after another. Narrator Bryan Kennedy does a nice job, providing a unique, recognizable voice for each character. He is even able to adeptly share the comic strip action scattered throughout the book with the audio audience. The pacing is also well done with the speed matching the tone of the story. This work will appeal to fans of the series as well as new fans of Rafe.&#x2014;Deanna Romriell, Salt Lake City Public Library</p><h2>Explorer (The Lost Islands #2)</h2><p>&nbsp; The highly anticipated second volume to the critically acclaimed Explorer series, <i>The Lost Islands </i>is a collection of seven all-new stories written and illustrated by an award-winning roster of comics artists, with each story centered around the theme of hidden places.

He lives in Alhambra, California.<b><p></p></b>Best known for his celebrated series Flight and Amulet, award-winning comics creator and editor Kibuishi presents the second volume of his comics anthology geared toward middle-school readers, after Explorer: The Mystery Boxes (2012). This collection features seven minicomics written or drawn by comics luminaries, such as Raina Telgemeier (Drama, 2012), Dave Roman, Michel Gagn�, and Kibuishi himself. Each fun and fantastical story centers on the theme of islands, both in a physical and philosophical sense. Kate Shanahan and Dave Shanahan&#x2019;s &#x201c;Radio Adrift&#x201d; tells the story of a radio DJ who wants to travel, so he takes his station with him. Roman and Telgemeier&#x2019;s &#x201c;Desert Island Playlist,&#x201d; meanwhile, finds a lonely girl&#x2014;who already felt alienated from her friends and family&#x2014;on a probably metaphorical desert island, where she discovers convenient company after some tidy self-reflection. Though not as inventive as its debut volume, this sophomore effort&#x2019;s solid artwork, dialogue, and stories will still be a great introductory title for young or struggling middle-school readers starting to explore the world of graphic novels.

He tried out a blond named Vicky&#x2015;a common male name in Finland&#x2015;followed by a Tarzan-inspired Jack. Then in 1968 Tom settled on Kake, a dark-haired, mustached leatherman who often wore a tight white T-shirt bearing the motto &#x201c;Fucker.&#x201d; Kake lived up to this moniker, a sort of post-Stonewall, hyper-masculine Johnny Appleseed traveling the world on his motorcycle to spread the seeds of liberated, mutually satisfying, ecstatically explicit gay sex. Tom lived out many of his most personal fantasies through Kake, and Kake&#x2019;s international fans made him the template for what came to be known as the gay clone look of the 1970s. Between 1968 and 1986, Tom published 26 episodes of Kake adventures, most as 20-page booklets.Tom of Finland &#x2013; The Complete Kake Comics collects all of these stories in one volume. Return with Kake to the days when men were men, sex was carefree, and everyone wore a big thick mustache.</p><p>Dian Hanson produced a variety of men&#x2019;s magazines from 1976 to 2001, including Juggs, Outlaw Biker, and Leg Show, before becoming TASCHEN&#x2019;s Sexy Book Editor. Her titles include the &#x201c;body part&#x201d; series, The Art of Pin-up, Psychedelic Sex, and Ren Hang.<br><br>Touko Laaksonen, the boy who would become Tom of Finland (1920-1991), began drawing cartoons at age five. His favorite subjects were the rough manly men of his native Finland, as Touko knew from an early age that men interested him more than women. His talents were further honed by art study in Helsinki. He found success in the Finnish advertising industry but secretly continued creating his increasingly erotic drawings of hyper-masculine men. In 1957 he submitted some drawings to the American magazine Physique Pictorial and the &#x201c;Tom of Finland&#x201d; legend was born. By the late 60s Tom&#x2019;s &#x201c;dirty drawings&#x201d; became the standard for gay art, and Tom&#x2019;s Men a template for a new gay masculinity. Tom&#x2019;s art continues to play an important role in promoting self-confidence, positive self-image and openness in the gay community.&#x201c;If you need proof that today&#x2019;s revolutions are tomorrow&#x2019;s institutions, look no further than the Finnish postage stamp recently earned by Touko Laaksonen, aka Tom of Finland... Over several decades, Tom of Finland&#x2019;s drawings, including his Kerouacan wandering alter ego, Kake, who he rendered in a sketchier style than his Cadmus-like signature tableaux, did more to promote gay male hyper-masculinity than James Dean, Brokeback Mountain, and Bob Paris combined. His cum-spurting leathermen are now coffee-table appropriate.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This new volume beautifully reproduces the most famous and arguably the best cartoon series in the history of gay art.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Kake allows Tom to express all his fantasies. Sailors, lifeguards, cowboys, policemen... &#x2015;all are invariably handsome, brawny, and enthusiastically gay when Kake comes along.&#x201d;</p><h2>Wiring Simplified: Based on the 2017 National Electrical Code�</h2><p>This 45th edition&#x2014;part of a series continuously published for more than 80 years and based on the 2017 National Electrical Code&#x2014;is a handy instruction manual that has been used by generations of readers to learn the &#x201c;why&#x201d; as well as the &#x201c;how-to&#x201d; of wiring practices.

For seven months, the veteran seafarer battled storms, doldrums, gear-failures, knock-downs, as well as overwhelming fatigue and loneliness. Then, nearing the finish, Moitessier pulled out of the race and sailed on for another three months before ending his 37,455-mile journey in Tahiti. Not once had he touched land.</p><p>Bernard Moitessier was born in 1925 in Indochina and much of his sailing knowledge was gained during time spent at sea with the fishermen of the Gulf of Siam. One of the greatest ocean voyagers, he became a legend in his time. He was also a gifted writer and wrote four books describing his seagoing adventures. He moved to France where he spent the last years of his life working on his memoirs, Tamata and the Alliance (Sheridan House, 1995), the story of an unusual man and an exciting life. Bernard Moitessier died in the summer of 1994.Moitessier is better known as one of the greatest ocean voyagers and was a legend in his time. Last month we reviewed the last book he wrote Tamata and the Alliance. This book is about his Round the World Race for singlehanded yachts. For Moitessier, the race finished in mid-Pacific after he had passed the three Capes and crossed his outward track, leading, and with the hardest sections behind him, he decided to forfeit the race and continue into the Pacific again, to anchor finally among friends in Tahiti. His actions were never explained by the news media; they could not have been, for the voyage had always been seen by Moitessier as something other than a sponsored, publicized, competitive event. It was on the ocean, alone with his boat, that Moitessier began to regard this as a voyage that could not end for him with the reward of those whose values were not his. (<i>Sailing Inland &amp; Offshore</i>)<br><br>One of the world's most famous ocean sailors, Moitessier had sailed for more than a year from Plymouth, England to the Indian Ocean when he inexplicably abandoned the lead in the 1968-1969 Round-the-World single-handed race. He sailed to Tahiti, dropped anchor and dropped out. Until the publication of this book, only Moitessier and a few friends knew why. Most of the book is a diary of that voyage with philosophical side trips into modern civilization. There is also a 60-page appendix that can stand alone as a small reference volume of details such as route planning, sail repair, the problems of sail and line chafe, rigging and hull construction, self-steering, freak waves and weather, plus much more. Altogether a strange, fascinating, and informative book.

I get bored easily so I make up crazy stuff to cope with reality. Some of that stuff is useless, but some takes shape and becomes fun to revisit. I knew my sister-in-law Liz wanted a story with sky castles, so floating castles were one of the first ingredients I threw into the stew. I may not be able to detail the origin of Five Kingdoms, but I can explain what I was aiming to accomplish. </p> <p>With <i>Five Kingdoms</i>, I wanted to bring together much of what I do best as a writer into one place. I wanted to merge some of the fun I put into <i>Candy Shop War</i>, with the discovery and adventure from <i>Fablehaven</i>, with some of the big world-building like I did in <i>Beyonders</i>. I wanted to create a world that opened up story possibilities I haven&#x2019;t seen before.</p> <p>The result is the Outskirts, where five different kingdoms are each governed by different types of magic. Some characters from our world get drawn into a fast-paced adventure that is sometimes scary and often strange but hopefully never boring. </p> <p>Paolini: We&#x2019;ve spoken before about your love of doorways, portals, and other such openings that transport you to strange and different places. That idea seems especially prominent in <i>Sky Raiders</i>. Is it something you thought about consciously when you were writing, or did it arise naturally from your interest in the subject? </p><p> Mull: Since my childhood, I&#x2019;ve loved the idea of characters being transported to another world through a wardrobe, down a rabbit hole, over the rainbow, etc. As a kid, after reading the <i>Narnia</i> series, I sincerely wished for something like that to happen to me. I wanted to be king of some world and kill all the monsters and ride on lions and save everybody. When that didn&#x2019;t pan out, I visited other worlds in my imagination instead.</p> <p>With <i>Five Kingdoms</i>, I&#x2019;m deliberately creating my most elaborate and varied world so far, and exploring it through the eyes of a character from our reality. Since each of the Five Kingdoms has different kinds of magic that work there, by the end of the series, readers essentially get to visit five new fantasy worlds in one.</p> <p> Paolini: Many of your books feature characters who are siblings&#x2014;specifically brother/sister&#x2014;or who feel like siblings. In this case it&#x2019;s Cole and Mira. Having a sister myself, I think you do a great job of portraying that sort of relationship. What is it, that you enjoy most about those kinds of characters? </p> <p> Mull: I grew up as the oldest of five kids. I did and said nice, loving things to my siblings that I didn&#x2019;t do or say to anyone else. And I did and said mean things to my siblings that I wouldn&#x2019;t dare do or say to my worst enemies. And my siblings returned the favor in good and bad ways. We had each other&#x2019;s back and we stabbed each other in the back.</p> <p>Brother and sister relationships are complicated and interesting. They help ground characters and bring them to life in ways that many readers can identify with. I enjoy trying to capture the blend of silly banter, heated arguments, and real love and protectiveness that I remember from my own family relationships.</p> <p> Paolini: It seems like you put a lot of thought into how the economy of the Five Kingdoms works. The sky raiders are scroungers, eking out a living on the edges of a very strange world. Much more interesting than just reading about kings and queens. How did you go about developing the economy and the society? </p> <p>Mull: Some people think of fantasy as nonsense where anything can happen, but I&#x2019;ve never seen it that way. To me, good fantasy doesn&#x2019;t abandon reality. Instead, it creates a functional reality with different rules than our own. If my fantasy worlds make sense and feel authentic, the reader will have an easier time getting involved and caring about the story. </p><p> Part of the task involves figuring out the logistics of how the world works. Who governs it? How do they maintain control? Who supports them? Who dislikes them? Given the reality I have established, I try to think through how the fantasy/magical elements in the story would affect day-to-day life. I especially try to think how people would exploit different magical abilities or artifacts for gain. </p> <p>Paolini: The magic in <i>Five Kingdoms</i> is really cool! I&#x2019;d love to know more about why you chose this particular kind of magic and what its particular advantages/disadvantages are. </p> <p> Mull: Each kingdom in Five Kingdoms has a different type of magic. Those in Sambria with magical talent can reshape reality as they desire. Only the most gifted can change reality in big ways and create beings called semblances that seem alive. Powerful shapers risk losing control and either becoming trapped in a nightmare of their own making or flat out destroying themselves and everything around them.</p> <p> That type of magic seemed cool and dangerous, and gave an excuse for me to take readers to some very unusual settings. I had to be careful not to let the magic feel too powerful, so I made it very dangerous to tamper with living things, I made the magic work better in certain geographic locations than others, and I didn&#x2019;t let any practitioners be flawless experts. </p> <p> Paolini: Have you plotted out the series from start to finish? If so, how much does the outline change as you write? </p> <p>Mull: I tend to daydream about my stories until I see them like movies in my mind. Then I convert that daydreamed adventure into written scenes. So I have a pretty firm blueprint at the start, but it evolves as I make discoveries along the way. </p><p> With Five Kingdoms, I know the kingdoms we&#x2019;ll be visiting, and the main events that will happen. Many details will be added as I go. </p> <p> Paolini: Who is your favorite character and why? </p> <p> Mull: So hard to pick! I like Cole because he really cares about his friends and takes responsibility for them accidentally getting taken to the Outskirts as slaves. I think he is funny and grounded and tries hard to do the right thing. </p> <p>Paolini: If you had to choose one magical item to use when raiding along with the sky raiders, which one would you choose? </p> <p> Mull: Of the items in the book, I&#x2019;d want Jace&#x2019;s golden rope. It was an item that he claimed when scouting out a sky castle. The rope can get longer and shorter as needed. It responds to the will of the wielder, so it can reach out and tangle an enemy, wrap around a distant object, coil and spring the wielder forward, or curl up to cushion a fall. The golden rope&#x2019;s extreme versatility would increase my chances of surviving a dangerous sky castle raid.</p>Brandon Mull is the author of the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>,&nbsp;<i>USA TODAY</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Wall Street Journal</i>&nbsp;bestselling Beyonders and Fablehaven series, as well as the bestselling Five Kingdoms, Candy Shop Wars, and Dragonwatch series.

Blending the country and folk music of the late sixties with the melodic seductiveness of Detroit-style roots rock, the Eagles brought a new sound to a stagnant music scene. Under the brilliant management of David Geffen, the Eagles projected a public image of unshakable camaraderie--embodied by the cerebral, brooding Don Henley and the intuitive, self-destructive Glenn Frey--bolstered by the gorgeous harmonies of their songs. Behind the scenes, however, there was another story.<br><br>At turns revealing, inspiring, funny, and shocking, <i>To the Limit</i> is the chronicle of a time, a place, and a group that succeeded in changing forever the world of popular music.</p><p><b>Marc Eliot</b>'s previous biographies include <i>Walt Disney: Hollywood's Dark Prince</i> and <i>Death of a Rebel: A Biography of Phil Ochs</i>. He lives in New York City.Veteran rock writer Eliot (Down Thunder Road: The Making of Bruce Springsteen) refuses to take it easy on the most commercially successful supergroup of the 1970s in this unauthorized, warts-and-all biography. As dons of the so-called Avocado Mafia, a loose association of singers and songwriters who first came together in Southern California in the late 1960s, the Eagles are, for Eliot, representative figures in a fascinating pop-culture drama. In tough, sometimes lyrical prose, Eliot shows how Don Henley, Glenn Frey, Bernie Leadon and Randy MeisnerAthe original members of the groupAbecame the top-selling and most influential rock band of the Me Decade by combining laid-back attitude with self-consciously eclectic musicianship. Nor did it hurt the group's quest for fame, Eliot makes clear, to have brilliant business and PR men such as David Geffen and Irving Azoff on the side of the Eagles from the beginning. Eliot's a savvy enough storyteller not to let in-depth analysis of the aural and business dimensions of the Eagles' saga get in the way of good dish: the book brims with anecdotes about the band's now-legendary hotel-room demolition sessions, prodigious substance abuse and tireless womanizing. Jackson Browne, Linda Ronstadt and David Crosby join more incongruous notables such as James Cagney, Kenny Rogers and Ronald Reagan's politically contrary daughter, Patti Davis, to make Eliot's account even more engaging. If the writing's purple at times, it's only because the band members' colorful excesses demand such treatment.

And he snatched the apple back from Jorinda, threw it into the chest, and slammed the heavy lid shut.</p><p>The stepsisters laughed loudly.</p><p></p><p></p><p>ALSO BY </p><p><b>Adam Gidwitz</b></p><p><b><i>A Tale Dark &amp; Grimm In a Glass Grimmly</i></b></p><p></p><p></p><p>Once upon a time, fairy tales were grim.</p><p><i>The Merriam-Webster Dictionary</i> defines the word <i>grim </i>as &#x201c;ghastly, repellent, or sinister in character.&#x201d; Their example of how to use the word is this: &#x201c;a <i>grim</i> tale.&#x201d; (Really! It says that!)</p><p>Once upon a time, fairy tales were Grimm, too. That is, they were collected by the brothers Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm.</p><p>You know the tales of the Brothers Grimm.</p><p>For example, raise your hand if you&#x2019;ve ever heard of a story called &#x201c;Little Red Riding Hood.&#x201d;</p><p>You haven&#x2019;t?</p><p>Oh, you have. Then why aren&#x2019;t you raising your hand? Go ahead and raise it. I don&#x2019;t care how stupid you look, sitting in the corner of the library by yourself, or on the school bus, or in bed at night, raising your hand for no apparent reason. How else am I supposed to know whether you&#x2019;ve read &#x201c;Little Red Riding Hood&#x201d;?</p><p>Raise it.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Okay, raise your hand if you&#x2019;ve heard of &#x201c;Hansel and Gretel.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Do it</i>.</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>Raise your hand if you&#x2019;ve heard of &#x201c;Rumpelstiltskin.&#x201d; (I assume you&#x2019;re raising your hand.)</p><p>&#x201c;Sleeping Beauty.&#x201d; (Your hand&#x2019;s still up, right?)</p><p>&#x201c;Snow White.&#x201d; (Of course you have.)</p><p>&#x201c;Cinderella.&#x201d; (Your hand <i>better</i> still be in the air.)</p><p>But now you&#x2019;re thinking: <i>Wait a minute. You said fairy tales used to be grim&#x2014;i.e., ghastly, repellent, sinister. These stories aren&#x2019;t ghastly, repellent, or sinister at all. They are cute, and sweet, and </i>boring<i>.</i></p><p>And, I must admit, these days you are correct. The versions of these stories that most people tell are indeed cute and sweet and incredibly, mind-numbingly, want-to-hit-yourself-in-the-head-with-a-sledgehammer-ingly boring.</p><p>But the original fairy tales were not.</p><p>Take &#x201c;Rumpelstiltskin,&#x201d; for example. You may know &#x201c;Rumpelstiltskin&#x201d; as a funny little tale about a funny little man with a funny not-all-that-little name.</p><p>But do you remember what happens at the end of that funny little story? The girl guesses his name, right? And he gets very angry. And do you remember what happens then?</p><p>No?</p><p>Well, in some versions of the story, Rumpelstiltskin stamps his foot and flies out the window.</p><p>Which makes no sense. Who has ever stamped their foot and suddenly gone flying out of a window? Impossible.</p><p>In other versions of the story, he stamps his foot and shatters into a thousand pieces.</p><p>This is even more ridiculous than him flying out of a window. People don&#x2019;t shatter. People are fleshy and bloody and gooey. <i>Shatter </i>is not something that people do.</p><p>So what actually happens when the girl guesses Rumpelstiltskin&#x2019;s name? In the real, Grimm version of the story?</p><p>Well, he stamps his foot so hard that it gets buried three feet in the ground. Then he grabs his other leg, and he pulls up on it with such force that he <i>rips himself in half</i>.</p><p>Which, it must be admitted, is indeed ghastly, repellent, sinister&#x2014;and <i>awesome</i>.</p><p>The story I am about to tell you is like that, too.</p><p>It is Grimm. And grim.</p><p>In fact, it is the grimmest, Grimmest tale that I have ever heard.</p><p>And I am sharing it with you.</p><p>Yeah. You&#x2019;re welcome.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Jorinda and Joringel</p><p></p><p></p><p>Once upon a time, in the days when fairy tales really happened, there lived a man and his wife. They were a happy couple, for they had everything their hearts desired. They had a little house, a little garden, and in the center of that garden, they had a pretty little juniper tree.</p><p>Yes, they had everything their hearts desired. Everything, that is, except a child. More than anything else&#x2014;more than their house, their garden, their tree&#x2014;this couple wanted a child. But they did not have one.</p><p>One winter&#x2019;s day, the wife stood in the garden beneath the juniper tree&#x2014;which is a handsome pine with needles so dark they are almost blue and little red berries that look like drops of blood. She was peeling an apple with a knife when her hand slipped, and she cut herself. A drop of her blood fell to the snowy ground. She saw the drop of blood on the snow, and she thought, &#x201c;Oh, how I wish I had a child, as red as blood and as white as snow.&#x201d;</p><p>Hold on. I have to interrupt.</p><p>You think you know this story. You think it&#x2019;s &#x201c;Snow White.&#x201d;</p><p>You think wrong.</p><p>If I wanted to be educational, I would explain that fairy tales often share &#x201c;motifs&#x201d; with one another&#x2014;images and phrases that crop up again and again, even in tales from different countries and cultures. Which is a little bit interesting.</p><p>I do not, though, have any desire to be educational.</p><p>No. I just want to tell you this completely messed-up story.</p><p>Well, a month went by, and the snow with it. Two months, and the world was green. Three months, and flowers came out of the ground. Four months, and the trees of the forest pressed hard upon one another and the green branches all mingled together. The fifth month passed, and the wife stood under the juniper tree as its blossoms fell to the earth. When the sixth month was gone, the berries had grown big and firm, and the woman became very still. After the seventh month, she snatched at the juniper berries and ate so greedily she grew sad and sickened. When the eighth month had passed, she called her husband and wept and said, &#x201c;If I die, bury me under the juniper tree.&#x201d; With that she took comfort and was happy until the ninth month. Then she bore twins: a little boy with dark hair, dark eyes, and lips as red as blood; and a little girl with dark hair and green eyes and cheeks as white as snow.</p><p>She brought them to her husband. This man took one look at his two beautiful children, and he was so happy that he died.</p><p>WHAT? He was so happy that he died?</p><p>Yup.</p><p>That sort of thing used to happen all the time. It was just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m so happy! I&#x2019;m so happy! I&#x2019;m so ha-a-a-ack-ack-ack&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Dead.</p><p>On the infants&#x2019; very first night in this world, their mother sat by the fire and wept with joy for her living children and with grief for her dead husband. The infants, off in their crib, wondered where their mother was, and why she was not holding them, and where that distant crying sound was coming from. At last, because a baby needs to be held, the infant girl reached out her tiny hand, and the infant boy reached out his, and they held on to one another.</p><p>Now, this mother was a very learned woman. She was known far and wide for her collection of old books and her mastery of dead languages. But no amount of learning or knowledge had prepared her to raise two children on her own. She had no books for that&#x2014;and what she did read about children in her ancient books had very little to do with these two delicate, squirming, crying creatures.</p><p>She was afraid. She feared that she would raise them badly. So she pretty much left them alone. She would feed them and clothe them and then she would retire to her study and pore over her ancient books in dead languages and try not to think too much about the babies who cried for her from the room upstairs.</p><p><br>------------------------------<br></p><p>Well, these babies grew, as babies will. Soon they were scampering around on their own, laughing and running and playing.</p><p>Everywhere the little boy went, the little girl went. And everywhere the little girl went, the little boy went. They tended to the house together and played together out of doors and tucked themselves in bed at night and told each other bedtime stories&#x2014;so their mother wouldn&#x2019;t have to stop her studies. And they rarely called each other by their names, which were strange and German and hard to pronounce. They called each other Little Brother and Little Sister, even though they were just about exactly the same age. They loved each other so dearly that one grew sad when the other was out of sight. The little boy would often say to his sister, &#x201c;If you won&#x2019;t leave me, I won&#x2019;t leave you.&#x201d; To which the little girl would always reply, &#x201c;I will never, ever leave you.&#x201d;</p><p>Now, even though the children called one another Little Brother and Little Sister, I can&#x2019;t manage to tell their entire story without using their names. I did try, but it gets very confusing. For example, if I want to let you know that one of them looked little, I can&#x2019;t say, &#x201c;The enormous, murderous ogre peered down at little Little Sister.&#x201d; That would sound weird.</p><p>Since I&#x2019;m going to need to use their names, you&#x2019;re going to have to learn to pronounce them. Even if the children, generally, didn&#x2019;t bother.</p><p>The little girl&#x2019;s name was Jorinda. You pronounce that YOUR-INDA.</p><p>The little boy&#x2019;s name was Joringel. You pronounce that: YOUR-INGLE.</p><p>Yes, German is weird.</p><p>As the years went by, the mother became more and more worried about her children. She worried that she neglected them, and she worried that they had no one who knew how to guide their growth properly.</p><p>So she decided to marry again. She consulted all the ancient books that she owned, considered all the single men in the village, and decided on her husband.</p><p>The man she chose was neither handsome nor very kind, but he was a good cook, and the mother had read that growing children need good, hearty food to help them grow.</p><p>Also, he had two beautiful daughters, just a little bit older than Jorinda and Joringel. So the man knew how to raise children. That, the mother decided, was good, too.</p><p>And everything was good. For a few days.</p><p>Jorinda (that&#x2019;s the girl) and Joringel (that&#x2019;s the boy) always cleaned the house and took care of all the chores, so their mother did not have to interrupt her important studies. Well, one day, they asked their new stepsisters if they wanted to help clean the house. </p><p>The girls flipped their long, beautiful hair and laughed. &#x201c;Why would we <i>want</i> to help?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You look like you&#x2019;re doing a fine job on your own!&#x201d;</p><p>And they walked away giggling.</p><p>So Jorinda and Joringel went into the kitchen where their stepfather was cooking and asked if they could have some help with the laundry, now that there was twice as much of it to do. He brandished a wooden spoon and chased them away.</p><p>Soon, Jorinda and Joringel began to realize that their new family members did not like them very much. In fact, the stepsisters loathed Jorinda and teased her cruelly. And the stepfather hated Joringel with a passion as hot as the hottest coal. I don&#x2019;t know why. He just did.</p><p><br>------------------------------<br></p><p>One day, Jorinda and Joringel found themselves standing outside their mother&#x2019;s study.</p><p>The little boy sniffled hard. &#x201c;I wish Mama would come out.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Shh,&#x201d; said Jorinda. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t disturb her.&#x201d;</p><p>Joringel&#x2019;s jaw was moving sideways, back and forth. This either meant he was thinking about something or he was going to cry. Jorinda was nervous about both possibilities.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to knock,&#x201d; said Joringel.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t!&#x201d; Jorinda hissed. But before she could stop him, he had rapped three times on the door of their mother&#x2019;s study.</p><p>Behind the door, they could hear a chair being pushed back and pages being shuffled. &#x201c;Coming!&#x201d; a voice called.</p><p>Jorinda tried to pull her brother away, but Joringel stood firm.</p><p>The door opened, and their mother appeared. Her long hair was held up in a messy bun behind her head, and she was blinking, as if she weren&#x2019;t used to looking at anything that wasn&#x2019;t words on a page. When she saw the children, she smiled sadly and knelt before them.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, my dears?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>Suddenly, Joringel didn&#x2019;t know what to say. He looked at the floor.</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing, Mama,&#x201d; Jorinda cut in. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re sorry to disturb you.&#x201d;</p><p>But her mother said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not disturbing me. What is it?&#x201d;</p><p>Joringel raised his head. His eyes were brimming with tears.</p><p>The mother took her children by their small hands and led them into her study.</p><p>The walls were lined with ancient volumes, huge books bound with leather and nails. It smelled musty in there, but the sunlight slanted warm and bright through the small window. Jorinda and Joringel felt like they were entering a secret temple. Neither breathed.</p><p>The mother sat down by her desk and, holding her children&#x2019;s hands, looked into their eyes. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s bothering you?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>Joringel said, &#x201c;I wish we had our real father with us.&#x201d;</p><p>His mother nodded. &#x201c;So do I. Every day. Every night, when I try to sleep, the pain is like a stone under my mattress. But do you know what to do when there&#x2019;s a stone under your mattress that you just can&#x2019;t get rid of?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Get another mattress, and another, and another. Bury the stone under mattresses, until you don&#x2019;t feel it anymore.&#x201d;</p><p>Joringel squinted. &#x201c;You sleep with lots of mattresses on your bed, Mama?&#x201d;</p><p>His mother smiled. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a metaphor.&#x201d;</p><p>Joringel didn&#x2019;t know what a metaphor was. Neither did Jorinda, but she wasn&#x2019;t about to let the longest conversation they had had with their mother in years end yet. So she said, &#x201c;I hate our stepsisters. They&#x2019;re selfish, and they&#x2019;re mean.&#x201d;</p><p>Her mother pressed her lips together. Then she said, &#x201c;Anger is a weed, Jorinda. It grows up through the soil, choking every other plant. You must stamp it out. Don&#x2019;t let it enter your garden. Stamp out your anger until it never comes back.&#x201d;</p><p>Both children held their faces tight. Jorinda was trying to stamp out her anger. Joringel was trying to smother his pain. Suddenly, a single tear choked its way out of Joringel&#x2019;s eye. His mother reached out her finger and caught it. She wiped it on her shirt. &#x201c;And never cry,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Choke back your tears. Tears are waves on the ocean of sadness. You will drown in them if you&#x2019;re not careful. Believe me. I know.&#x201d;</p><p>Then Jorinda and Joringel&#x2019;s mother turned back to the ancient books on her desk. She clenched her jaw and exhaled through her nose, like she was steeling herself against something. She began to read.</p><p>Jorinda took her brother by the arm and led him away.</p><p>Excuse me. I have a question.</p><p>What do you think of the advice that Jorinda and Joringel&#x2019;s mother just gave them?</p><p>Is it good to stamp out your anger? To choke back your tears? To smother your pain? Is that how you find peace?</p><p>I&#x2019;m just wondering. &#x2019;Cause I&#x2019;d like to know. </p><p>Also, you&#x2019;re probably thinking, <i>Hey! You promised to tell us a grim and messed-up story. This story isn&#x2019;t messed up. It&#x2019;s all emotional and stuff!</i></p><p>Y...</p></p><h2>Navy SEAL Shooting: Learn how to shoot from their leading instructor</h2><p>Imagine if you could learn to shoot safely and effectively at home &#x2014; saving you time and money you don&#x2019;t have.

I want to help people get further, faster, and be more satisfied with their work. There were four real motivators for the book. <br><br><i><b>1. TELL ALL THE SECRETS</b></i> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was very fortunate to get a lot of help from smart people who cared about me along the way. Because of that, I was told a lot of important things that no one else was. Without executive-level, personal mentors, most people don't ever get to learn about what really matters and what really works. They don't learn how to avoid the common pitfalls or get the insights they need to survive the confusing and rough times. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I want to give away all the secrets-all the executive, insider information that is typically shared with only a select few people who get taken under a mentor's wing. <br><br><i><b>2. I HATE WASTED TIME </b></i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hate wasting anything, particularly time, energy, and potential. So I don't like to see people wasting time, investing their heart and energy, but not getting anywhere-and, in fact, burning career capital. <br><br>You see, I am a maximizer through and through. What I mean by that is that I am driven to find the most direct and effective path to accomplish things and then do them the best they can be done, whether that is being a CEO or making a tuna sandwich. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As such, I invest enormous amounts of time, thought, and energy to figure out how to do something an easier, faster, or better way. I refuse to let my time get burned up on things that don't make a big difference or have a significant payoff. So I've spent a lot of the last twenty-five years figuring out how to tune my actions and invest my efforts to maximize the payoff for the businesses and for my career. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know what works. I got there. I know how you can get the career you want. Through all my learning, mistakes, failures, embarrassments, wins, and advances (and maximizing) along the way, I've broken the code. I have defined and developed a concrete, practical, and repeatable approach for building the success you want. I've learned how to benefit both my business and my career and not get killed in the process. And I want to share how you can do it, too. <br><br><i><b>3. IT'S OK TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF</b></i><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to help people recognize that taking care of your career is not selfish. When you start managing your career on purpose, you end up doing a better job because in order to advance your career, you must add more value to the business. In fact, adding more value is the only reliable way to advance. So taking control of your career is not just good for you; your team and your company also benefit because you become more capable and more valuable. Conversely, if you never focus on taking care of yourself, you will get buried with work, burned out, and used up and you'll miss the chance to grow. <br><br><i><b>4. YOU CAN GET THERE</b></i><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been a huge lesson for me that breakout success can come from doing relatively simple things. The key is in the doing. And the things that have the biggest impact are all very doable; the problem is that they are easy to miss if you don't learn them and if you don't make it a point to do them on purpose. <br><br><i><b>WHERE I CAME FROM </b></i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Growing up, I was a fat kid and a nerd. I was an artist, a singer, and an actor, and I was drawn to math and science. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I started at university, I was registered as a fine arts major, but when I showed up at orientation I heard my mother's voice in my head saying (for as far back as I could remember), "You will go to college. You will get a good education and a good job and you will support yourself. Never rely on anyone else to support you. That's your job." <br><br>So, fearing I would struggle to earn a good living as an artist, I crossed out "Fine arts," penciled in "Electronic engineering," and went to stand in the electronic engineering line. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After college, I began my career at Bell Labs in Holmdel, New Jersey, as an engineer in the robotics research lab. I hated it. I was miserable and thought I had screwed up my life (more on this and what I did about it later). <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went on to work in individual roles as a technical sales consultant, a sales rep, a product manager, and a product marketing manager. I did plenty of trade show booth duty. I know what it's like to start in a thankless, entry-level job. <br><br>In my late twenties I got my first big multilevel management job running a software development organization of about 150 people. I eventually held executive roles in marketing and sales organizations as well as general management. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My career really took off when I became Hewlett Packard's youngest general manager at the age of thirty-three. I was running a $1 billion software business for HP at thirty-five and was CEO of a private software company at thirty-eight. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am very lucky to still have the guidance of many mentors and brilliant people who care about me. I could not have achieved any level of success without the support of my parents, sister, and husband. I still enjoy art and I'm an avid cyclist and scuba diver. I donate to charities and I like expensive shoes. I am no longer fat but I am still kind of a nerd.</p><h2>The Prepper&#39;s Blueprint: The Step-By-Step Guide To Help You Through Any Disaster</h2><p>Across the ages, in every survival story, a disaster of some sort plays a prominent role. Sometimes the part is played by the government, sometimes it is played by Mother Nature, and other times, the role is taken on by a random mishap. If we have learned one thing studying the history of disasters, it is this: those who are prepared have a better chance at survival than those who are not. A crisis rarely stops with a triggering event. The aftermath can spiral, having the capacity to cripple our normal ways of life. Because of this, it's important to have a well-rounded approach to our preparedness efforts. Due to the overwhelming nature of preparedness, we have created the Prepper's Blueprint to help get you and your family ready for life's unexpected emergencies. To make a more comprehensive, easy-to-follow program, The Prepper's Blueprint has been simplified and divided up in a way to help you make sense of all the preparedness concepts and supply lists provided. We have divided the chapters into layers of preparedness. Layer 1: Chapters 1-14, prepares you for those everyday disasters that have shorter-term effects: power outages, storms, injuries, and evacuations&nbsp;Layer 2: Chapters 15-31 help you to get ready for disasters that turn out to be much longer-lasting: economic collapse, long term power outages, and pandemics, to name a few&nbsp;Layer 3: Chapters 32-56 prepares you for the long haul and a complete change of lifestyle, the end of the world as we know it: providing food and water once supplies run out, security, retreat properties, and long-term plans The goal of The Prepper's Blueprint is to help you find freedom through self-reliance, and ultimately, to get you and your family to a point where you can not only survive, but thrive, in a world that may be permanently altered.</p><p>For the last few years, many readers have asked me for a downloadable version of my online series, 52 Weeks to Preparedness. As much as I wanted to turn the series into a pdf, I wanted it to be more - much more. I wanted to add even more information and organize and transform it into a book that encompassed all forms of disasters - both big and small. I even changed the name to The Prepper's Blueprint&nbsp;to help readers understand that preparedness isn't just about having a plan, it requires drawing out a blueprint to set a preparedness foundation you can build upon and rely on when the time comes.I believe that to fully insulate yourself from a disaster of any kind, you need to have a layered effect with your supplies. This will create a well-rounded approach and ensure that you are prepared for the smallest disasters to the most severe circumstances.&nbsp;This 458 page resource starts your preparedness efforts from the beginning two week disaster and takes you through, step-by-step, to more longer term disasters. Packed with expert advice, supply lists, skills building techniques and supplemental resources, this book is the most comprehensive preparedness resource available.Since 2007, Tess Pennington, founder of Ready Nutrition, has focused on educating the public on topics including disaster preparedness, natural living, homesteading, emergency food pantries, food storage and ultimately self-reliance. <br> &nbsp;<br> <br> She is formally trained in emergency and disaster management response with the American Red Cross.<br> &nbsp;<br> <strong>She is the best-selling author of two preparedness books. </strong>&nbsp;<strong><i>The Prepper's Blueprint:</i></strong><i>&nbsp;The Step-By-Step Guide To Help You Through Any Disaster</i><strong>, is a comprehensive guide that uses real-life scenarios to help the reader prepare for any disaster.&nbsp;The well-rounded, multi-layered approach outlined in the</strong>&nbsp;<b>Blueprint</b>&nbsp;<strong>coaches the reader in making sense of a wide array of preparedness concepts through easily digestible action items and supply lists.</strong><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> <strong>In addition to <i>The Prepper's Blueprint</i>, Tess is also the author of the highly rated</strong>&nbsp;<b><i>Prepper's Cookbook</i></b><strong>,&nbsp;which has sold over 10,000 copies and focuses on helping the reader create a plan for stocking, organizing and maintaining a proper emergency food supply, and it includes over 300 recipes for nutritious, life-saving meals.&nbsp;</strong><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> <strong>Visit her web site at&nbsp;ReadyNutrition.com&nbsp;for an extensive compilation of free information on preparedness, homesteading, and healthy living.</strong></p><h2>LSAT Prep Plus 2020-2021: Strategies for Every Section + Real LSAT Questions + Online (Kaplan Test Prep)</h2><p><b>Kaplan's <i>The LSAT Unlocked 2020-2021</i> features official LSAT practice questions, detailed explanations, and in-depth strategies to help you score higher.

In 1115, the gruff old hermit warrior Celanawe was a much younger mouse and embarks on a treacherous quest across a sea and into unmapped ferret territory to find the fabled Black Axe. Though Black Axe works well enough as a stand-alone adventure, Celanawe&#x2019;s origin story promises plenty of revelation to readers familiar with Mouse Guard lore. Still, both newcomers and fans alike will find much to explore in Petersen&#x2019;s finely wrought artwork, high-stakes intrigue, and derring-do tale.

Neighbors Roman and Minnie Castavet soon come nosing around to welcome the Woodhouses to the building, and despite Rosemary's reservations about their eccentricity and the weird noises that she keeps hearing, her husband takes a special shine to them. Shortly after Guy lands a plum Broadway role, Rosemary becomes pregnant, and the Castavets start taking a special interest in her welfare. As the sickened Rosemary becomes increasingly isolated, she begins to suspect that the Castavets' circle is not what it seems...</p><p>When published in 1967, <i>Rosemary's Baby</i> was one of the first contemporary horror novels to become a national bestseller. Ira Levin's second novel (he went on to write such fine thrillers as <i>A Kiss Before Dying</i>, <i>The Stepford Wives</i>, and <i>The Boys from Brazil</i>), <i>Rosemary's Baby</i>, remains perhaps his best work. The author's mainstream "this is how it really happened" style undeniably also made the novel his most widely imitated. The plot line is deceptively simple: What if you were a happily married young woman, living in New York, and one day you awoke to find yourself pregnant? And what if your loving husband had--apparently--sold your soul to Satan? And now you were beginning to believe that your unborn child was, in reality, the son of Satan? Levin subtly makes it all totally plausible, unless of course, dear Rosemary--or the reader--can no longer distinguish fantasy from reality! A wonderfully chilling novel, it was later faithfully transformed into an equally unnerving motion picture.

Model daily reading habits. </b>As literacy expert Stephen Krashen reminds us, &#x201c;Children read more when they see other people reading.&#x201d; Talk with children about what you are reading and why you find reading personally interesting and meaningful. </p> <p><b>2. Set aside time for daily reading.</b> If we value reading, we must make time for it. Children who read at least 20 minutes a day score in the top range on reading tests and express more motivation and interest in reading. Even short blocks of time every day are better than bursts of reading on a occasional basis. </p> <p> <b>3. Carry a book with you everywhere.</b> When packing for trips or running errands, throw books and magazines into the suitcase or back seat. Carrying something to read helps ward off &#x201c;reading emergencies&#x201d;&#x2014;those times when you are stuck waiting without anything to do. The number one way adult readers rack up reading time is stealing short reading breaks in between other obligations. Carrying a book with you shows children how to steal this reading time.</p> <p> <b>4. Provide a wide variety of reading material. </b> Fiction and nonfiction, print and online magazines, graphic novels and comics&#x2014;children need access to lots of texts that match their interests and reading ability. You never know what book or topic might engage a child with reading. </p> <p> <b>5. Read aloud with children. </b> Sharing books with children&#x2014;even teenagers&#x2014;reinforces that reading is important and something you find personally rewarding. Through reading aloud, you send pleasure messages about reading and can share books with children that they might not be able to read on their own. With older children, reading together can provide a launching point for discussions and help you connect on a regular basis. Burdened with homework and after school activities, many teens stop reading for pleasure. Reading together can keep them invested.</p> <p><b> 6. Visit the library often. </b> Beyond free access to thousands of books, libraries offer qualified librarians and staff who can help match reading material to your child&#x2019;s interest and locate online and print resources to support children&#x2019;s needs. Most libraries host reading events and programs like summer reading clubs, too.</p> <p><b> 7. Celebrate all reading. </b> Children read more when they are given choices in what they read. When reading for pleasure, children should control their own book selection with your personal limits on content and topics the only restrictions. Do not push children to read harder books, abandon picture books and comics, or limit their choices by reading levels when selecting pleasure reading books at the library or bookstore.</p> <p><b> 8. Limit screen time. </b> The more time children spend using electronic devices and watching television, the less they read. While children need digital literacy skills, reading websites and surfing online don&#x2019;t provide the same vocabulary development or reading stamina that reading books and magazines do. If children read e-books on electronic devices, shut off Internet access and limit other features during daily reading time.</p><p><b>Donalyn Miller</b>, known as "The Book Whisperer" for her insightful advice on what students like to read and how to foster independent reading, teaches language arts and social studies at Peterson Elementary in Fort Worth, Texas.<br><b><br>Susan Kelley</b> has taught reading for over thirty years and currently teaches language arts and social studies at Trinity Meadows Intermediate in Keller, Texas.</p></p><h2>Alfie: (The Turtle That Disappeared)</h2><p>Nia loves Alfie, her pet turtle.

That is until the night before Nia&#x2019;s seventh birthday, when nAlfie disappears! Then, in an innovative switch in point of view, we hear Alfie&#x2019;s side of the story. He didn&#x2019;t leave Nia&#x2014;he&#x2019;s actually searching for the perfect birthday present for his dear friend. Can he find a gift and make it back in time for the big birthday party?<br><br> From the author-illustrator of <i>Fraidyzoo </i>and <i>The Bear Report</i> comes a warm and funny ode to friendship&#x2014;even when the friends see the relationship, and the world, very differently.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Thyra Heder</b> is the author of <i>Fraidyzoo</i> and <i>The Bear Report</i>. She is also an illustrator and storyboard artist for film and advertising.&nbsp; She lives in Brooklyn.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;PreS-Gr 2&#x2014;A girl named Nia gets a pet turtle on her sixth birthday. She names him Alfie and the two of them spend a year together with Nia making every effort to include her pet in all her activities. But turtles will be turtles&#x2014;not being the most playful or cuddly as pets go&#x2014;and Nia loses interest. Then, on the morning of Nia's seventh birthday, Alfie goes missing. That's when the story changes from Nia's to Alfie's point of view, as the intrepid turtle goes on the hunt for the perfect gift for Nia's birthday. He first explores around the house, encountering the family dog, then ventures out onto the fire escape, down into the yard, and through a sandbox until he grows cold and tired. A friendly snail suggests that Alfie take a nap in the pond in the yard. Readers see the passage of time illustrated through the change in seasons from fall to winter and then spring, when Alfie wakes up from his "nap" and emerges from the pond just in time to celebrate what Alfie believes is Nia's seventh birthday. Readers will delight to see the two reunited and will notice that it is actually Nia's eighth birthday, as the number indicates on her birthday balloon. The beautiful ink-and-watercolor illustrations, which feature an African American child (and her family), offer readers lots of clues and thoughtful details. An author's note tells how the story is based on Heder's real-life pet turtle Alfie that she got when she was six.

My worldly goods are a knapsack and some dried bread in it, and a Bible in my breast pocket. And that is all."<br></i>With this modest and simple statement, one of the world's great classics of spirituality begins. An anonymous Russian peasant of the nineteenth century sets out to seek the truth, attempting to follow St. Paul's command to "pray without ceasing."

Far predating the Lesser Keys and associated works, it dates to between the first and fifth centuries, seemingly basing part of its content on proto-judaean lore and Greek works as well. It contains, as well, an allusion to the concept, simply, &#34;As above, so below&#34;- one of the earlier references to such, if the earlier dating is true. It describes a host of demons encountered by King Solomon during his time spent enslaving the same, for the purposes of the building of the temple at Jerusalem. Attendant to him in his wisdom, the &#34;Queen of the South&#34; (presumably Egyptian) and the land of Arabia, entreating his wisdom and power to rid them of demonic forces. To any who wish to practice later works involving these same demonic entities or associated forces (such as with the Lesser Keys) this remains one of the more valuable pieces of source material; far older and potentially closer to the original story.</p><p></p><h2>Brimstone (Agent Pendergast Series, 5)</h2><p><b>When FBI Special Agent Pendergast discovers a murder in the attic of a Long Island estate, a scorched claw print leads him down a dark trail of unspeakable terror.</b><br> A body is found in the attic of a fabulous Long Island estate.<br>There is a claw print scorched into the wall, and the stench of sulfur chokes the air.<br>When FBI Special Agent Pendergast investigates the gruesome crime, he discovers that thirty years ago four men conjured something <em>unspeakable</em>.<br>Has the devil come to claim his due?<br>Some things can't be undone.</p><p>The thrillers of Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child "stand head and shoulders above their rivals" (<em>Publishers Weekly</em>). Preston and Child's <em>Relic</em> and <em>The Cabinet of Curiosities</em> were chosen by readers in a National Public Radio poll as being among the one hundred greatest thrillers ever written, and <em>Relic</em> was made into a number-one box office hit movie. They are coauthors of the famed Pendergast series and their recent novels include<em> Fever Dream</em>, <em>Cold Vengeance</em>, <em>Two Graves</em>, and <em>Gideon's Corpse</em>. In addition to his novels, Preston writes about archaeology for the New Yorker and Smithsonian magazines. Lincoln Child is a former book editor who has published five novels of his own, including the huge bestseller <em>Deep Storm</em>. <br>Readers can sign up for The Pendergast File, a monthly "strangely entertaining note" from the authors, at their website, www.PrestonChild.com. The authors welcome visitors to their alarmingly active Facebook page, where they post regularly.Ever since RELIC, the team of Preston and Child has created some of the best horror fiction of the genre, and BRIMSTONE continues their string of successes. Their main character, the mysterious FBI Agent Pendergast, is fascinating in his development. Although reader Ren� Auberjonois is masterful at bringing a number of characters to life with his voice, he is especially adept when speaking in Pendergast's honeyed Southern accent. The story deals with the horrible deaths of three men, deaths that seem to have been caused by spontaneous combustion. Together with Detective Vincent d'Agosta, Pendergast follows a trail of deceptive clues that lead them to the conclusion that Satan is responsible for the murders. Only the skills of Preston and Child could tie together a Stradivarius violin, a Chinese ballistic missile, and a remote Italian villa to create a chilling, suspenseful thriller.

He has a cold, and is feeling alone in his cave, snuffling and sneezing. Then all of his friends come to try and help him feel better.

They must save the lives of the seamen left stranded in the killer storm, and they have to do it in a tiny lifeboat. The crew is led by Bernie Webber, who has to rely on prayer and the courage of his three crewmembers to pull off the impossible.

They&#x2019;ve lost all navigation and have no idea where the stranded seaman are, and have no idea how to get back home.

G. Perry, 1898<br><br>CHATHAM, MASSACHUSETTS<br>February 18, 1952<br> <br>Boatswain&#x2019;s Mate First Class Bernie Webber held a hot mug of coffee in his large hands as he stared out the foggy window of the mess hall. The cup of mud wasn&#x2019;t half bad. It came from a three-gallon pot and was brewed by mixing the coffee with a couple of eggshells to help the grounds settle at the bottom. The minister&#x2019;s son from Milton, Massachusetts, watched with growing curiosity and concern as the storm continued to strengthen outside. The midwinter nor&#x2019;easter had stalled over New England for the last two days, and Webber wondered if the worst was yet to come. He watched as windswept snow danced over the shifting sands and large drifts piled up alongside the lighthouse tower in the front yard of the Chatham Lifeboat Station. At one time, two lighthouses had stood here; together they were known as the Twin Lights of Chatham. All that remained of the second lighthouse was an old foundation, and on this morning it was completely covered by snow.<br> <br>Taking a sip of his coffee, Webber thought of his young wife, Miriam, home in bed with a bad case of the flu at their cottage on Sea View Street. What if there was an emergency? What if she needed help? Would the doctor be able to reach her in this kind of weather? These questions were fraying his nerves and Webber fought to put them out of his mind. Instead he tried to picture the local fishermen all huddled around the old woodstove at the Chatham Fish Pier. They would be calling for his help soon as their vessels bobbed up and down on the waves in Old Harbor, straining their lines. If the storm is this bad now, what will it be like a few hours from now when it really gets going? he thought.<br> <br>Webber, however, wouldn&#x2019;t complain about the tough day he was facing. The boatswain&#x2019;s mate first class was only twenty-four years old, but he had been working at sea for nearly a decade, having first served with the U.S. Maritime Service during World War II. Webber&#x2019;s three older brothers had also served in the war. Paul, the eldest, had been with the Army&#x2019;s 26th Division in Germany. The so-called Yankee Division had fought in the Battle of the Bulge, joining General George S. Patton&#x2019;s Third Army in capturing the fortified city of Metz. Bob, his next brother, helped protect the homeland with the U.S. Coast Guard. The third, Bill, had helped build the Alaska Highway as a member of the Army Transportation Corps.<br> <br>Bernie had followed his brother Bob into the Coast Guard, but it was not the kind of life his parents had planned for him. From early childhood, Webber&#x2019;s father, the associate pastor at the Tremont Temple Church in Boston, had steered him toward a life in the ministry. The church deacon even paid for Bernie to attend the Mount Hermon School for Boys, located 105 miles away in Gill, Massachusetts, a small town hugging the Connecticut River. Established in 1879, the school boasted prestigious alumni such as Reader&#x2019;s Digest founder DeWitt Wallace and James W. McLamore, who founded Burger King. Needless to say, Bernie was something of an economic outcast amongst the prep school crowd. He arrived at Mount Hermon carrying serious doubts and wearing his brother&#x2019;s hand-me-down clothes. He was not a strong student and he privately questioned why he was there. Webber knew in his heart that he did not want to follow in his father&#x2019;s footsteps. He was thinking about running away from school when fate intervened; a childhood friend who had crashed his father&#x2019;s car came looking for a place to hide out. Webber obliged his buddy&#x2019;s request, ensconcing him in one of the dorm rooms and swiping food from the school cafeteria for him to eat. The two were caught after just a few days but they didn&#x2019;t stick around long enough to face the consequences. Instead they fled to the hills and cornfields surrounding the school and eventually made it back to Milton.<br> <br>The Reverend Bernard A. Webber struggled to understand the actions of his wayward son as young Bernie quit school and continued to drift. A year later, at the age of sixteen, Bernie got an idea that would change the course of his rudderless life. He heard that the U.S. Maritime Service was looking for young men like him for training in New York. If Bernie could complete the arduous training camp, he could then serve the war effort on a merchant ship. After his father reluctantly signed his enlistment papers, he quickly joined up and was schooled on the fundamentals of seamanship at the U.S. Maritime Service Training Station in Sheepshead Bay, New York, where he also received training from former world heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey, then serving as a commander in the Coast Guard as well as the athletic instructor at the training station. When he was finished, Webber shipped out on the SS Sinclair Rubiline, a T2 oil tanker that ran gasoline from ports in Aruba and Curacao to American warships of the U.S. Third Fleet in the South Pacific. During this time, the young man realized that he would not spend his life in the ministry or any other job on dry land. Bernie Webber had been born to the sea. He enlisted in the U.S. Coast Guard on February 26, 1946, and was sent to its training station at Curtis Bay, Maryland. In letters to recruits at the time, the commanding officer of the Coast Guard training station summed up the life and duty of a Coast Guardsman this way:<br><br>Hard jobs are routine in this service. In a way, the Coast Guard is always at war; in wartime, against armed enemies of the nation; and in peacetime, against all enemies of mankind at sea; Fire, Collision, Lawlessness, Gales, Ice, Derelicts, and many more. The Coast Guard, therefore, is no place for a quitter, or for a crybaby, or for a lying four-flusher, or anyone who cannot keep his eye on the ball. Your period of recruit training is a time of a test, hour by hour and day by day, to determine whether or not you are made of the right material. It is up to you, as an individual to prove your worth.<br><br>Webber was now on duty in Chatham, a tiny outpost at the elbow of Cape Cod. His worth and his mettle had already been tested many times in the unforgiving waters off the Cape. It was one of the busiest and most dangerous places for anyone who made their living on the sea. The director of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey made a point of this way back in 1869. &#x201c;There is no other place in the world, perhaps,&#x201d; he wrote about the waters off Cape Cod, &#x201c;where tides of such very small rise and fall are accompanied by such strong currents running far out to sea.&#x201d; In fact, seamen referred to the area as &#x201c;the graveyard of the Atlantic,&#x201d; and for good reason. The sunken skeletons of more than three thousand shipwrecks were scattered across the ocean floor from Chatham to Provincetown. The first known wreck was the Sparrowhawk, which ran aground on December 17, 1626, in Orleans. The crew, along with colonists bound for Virginia, managed to get to shore safely, and the vessel was repaired. But before it could hoist its sails again, another devastating ocean storm came along and sunk the Sparrowhawk for good. The episode was detailed by Governor William Bradford in his diary of the Plymouth Colony. Two hundred years later, erosion brought the wreckage into view in a mud bank along the Orleans coastline. The famous HMS Somerset also met her fate in the treacherous waters off Cape Cod. The ship, immortalized in Longfellow&#x2019;s poem &#x201c;The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere,&#x201d; was wrecked in the shoals off Truro during a violent gale on November 3, 1778. Twenty-one British officers and seamen drowned when their lifeboat overturned coming ashore. The ship&#x2019;s captain, George Ourry, surrendered to Truro selectman Isaiah Atkins on behalf of his 480-man crew. The survivors were taken as prisoners of war and were then marched to Boston, escorted by town militias along the way. (Paul Revere, who had once rowed stealthily past the Somerset to alert Lexington and Concord of the British invasion, was later given the ship&#x2019;s sixty-four guns to help fortify Castle Island in Boston Harbor.) As author Henry C. Kittredge observed in Cape Cod: Its People &amp; Their History (1930), &#x201c;If all the wrecks which have been piled upon the back-side of Cape Cod were placed bow to stern, they would make a continuous wall from Chatham to Provincetown.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bernie Webber&#x2019;s baptism under fire had come during an evening in 1949 when he responded to his first distress call at the Chatham Lifeboat Station. The Gleaves-class destroyer USS Livermore had run aground on Bearse&#x2019;s Shoal, off Monomoy Island. Luck had sailed with the Livermore up to that point. Her crew had managed to dodge Nazi U-boat wolfpacks while escorting convoys to Iceland bound for England in the months before the United States entered World War II. On November 9, 1942, the destroyer took part in the Allied invasion of North Africa, providing antisubmarine, antiaircraft, and fire support off Mehdia, French Morocco. The Livermore had survived the war relatively unscathed, a fact that some of her crew members ascribed to the fact that she was the first American warship to be named after a Navy chaplain, Samuel Livermore.<br> <br>First Class Boatswain Mate Leo Gracie took Webber and a crew on a 38-foot Coast Guard picket boat over the treacherous Chatham Bar to where the Livermore lay with a Naval Reserve crew stranded on board. The ship rested high up on the shoal and was leaning dangerously on its side. Webber and the men stayed with the destroyer for the rest of the night as salvage tugs were called in. The next morning, the Coast Guardsmen assisted in several failed attempts to free the warship before finally achieving success and sending the Livermore safely on its way. Webber smiled as the Livermore&#x2019;s crew cheered him and his crew. The sailors had given him quite a different reception hours earlier when they pelted him with apples, oranges, and even eight-ounce steel shackles, because in their eyes the rescue mission was taking too long. It was all part of a friendly rivalry between the Navy and the Coasties. The Naval Reserve crew was no doubt a little embarrassed that its rescue came at the hands of the Coast Guard, or the Hooligan&#x2019;s Navy as they called it.<br> <br>Yes, the life of a Coast Guardsman was often a thankless one, but Webber would not trade it for any other job in the world. And now, just after dawn, he gazed out the window of the mess hall, listened to the wind howl, and wondered what the day would bring.</p><h2>Feng Shui that Makes Sense - Easy Ways to Create a Home that FEELS as Good as it Looks</h2><p>You don't need to be a professional designer or a feng shui expert in order to have a beautiful, comfortable home. <i>Feng Shui That Makes Sense</i> takes you step-by-step through the process of using feng shui principles to create a home that will please your eye, relax your body, inspire your mind, and lift your spirit. <p>After reading this book, you will be able to: <br>- Easily create a home of beauty, harmony, and comfort <br>- Learn basic feng shui principles that work every time in every space <br>- Improve the look and feel of any room in your home <br>- Discover the origins of popular feng shui myths and misunderstandings <br>- Enhance the areas of your home relating to Love, Money, Health, Family, and more <br>- Apply feng shui principles to your landscape and garden <br>- Integrate nature and natural materials into your living space <br>- Clear your home of unwanted energy <br>- Create a home that nurtures and inspires you physically, mentally, and spiritually <br>- Understand how and why your environment affects you the way it does</p></p><p>"Cathleen takes you to the true heart of feng shui by pushing aside superstition to present the deepest pearls of feng shui wisdom.

Going beyond turn-of-the-century standards for carefully delineated and composed landscapes filled with transparent washes, his confidently bold, dense strokes and loosely defined forms startled critics and fellow practitioners alike. One reviewer of an exhibition in London proclaimed him &#x201c;an eagle in a dove-cote&#x201d;; another called his work &#x201c;swagger&#x201d; watercolors. For Sargent, however, the watercolors were not so much about swagger as about a renewed and liberated approach to painting. In watercolor, his vision became more personal and his works more interconnected, as he considered the way one image--often of a friend or favorite place--enhanced another. Sargent held only two major watercolor exhibitions in the United States during his lifetime. The contents of the first, in 1909, were purchased in their entirety by the Brooklyn Museum of Art. The paintings exhibited in the other, in 1912, were scooped up by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. <i>John Singer Sargent Watercolors</i> reunites nearly 100 works from these collections for the first time, arranging them by themes and subjects: sunlight on stone, figures reclining on grass, patterns of light and shadow. Enhanced by biographical and technical essays, and lavishly illustrated with 175 color reproductions, this publication introduces readers to the full sweep of Sargent&#x2019;s accomplishments in this medium, in works that delight the eye as well as challenge our understanding of this prodigiously gifted artist.<br><br>The international art star of the Gilded Age, <b>John Singer Sargent</b> (1856&#x2013;1925) was born in Italy to American parents, trained in Paris and worked on both sides of the Atlantic. Sargent is best known for his dramatic and stylish portraits, but he was equally active as a landscapist, muralist, and watercolor painter. His dynamic and boldly conceived watercolors, created during travels to Tuscan gardens, Alpine retreats, Venetian canals and Bedouin encampments, record unusual motifs that caught his incisive eye.</p><p>Experimenting with unusual compositions and new techniques, he reinvented himself aesthetically... far from stagnating Sargent was innovating in his watercolors.

In 100 essays, you learn simple strategies that "lighten your spirits, open your heart, enhance your life, and broaden your perspective." A tall order for a tiny book! (Actually, the book is only tiny because the print is small enough to make boomers and older readers wonder if they need stronger reading glasses--who made that silly decision?)<p> Many of the two- to three-page essay topics are familiar tips you've probably encountered before--let go of past history, be best friends, stop keeping score, be kind, express your love, be a good listener, and remember that your partner can't read your mind, for example. But even though they aren't earth-shaking or revolutionary, having 100 of them in one book makes it easy to read chapters with your partner and share views, discussing ways to put each strategy into action. And certainly if you use even a quarter of these relationship reminders, you and your partner can't help but become closer. This is the first book Richard has written with his wife, Kristine. The essays grew out of what the Carlsons have learned about keeping a relationship vital and loving over 14 years of marriage. <i>--Joan Price</i></p><strong>Richard Carlson, Ph.D.</strong>, was the author of the bestselling <em>Don't Sweat the Small Stuff</em> series.

However, White Eagle&#39;s &#39;voice&#39; is timeless and the depth of awareness and explanation, as well as advice, resonates strongly with the needs and challenges of our modern lives. Therefore, much of the material in the publications is not only philosophical, but provides us with ways of approaching all aspects of life in a practical, as well as spiritual, way. This famous collection of White Eagle sayings has already sold over 400,000 copies. Following the Master within&#39; is the theme for the sayings in this book. This pocket-sized book seems to touch people from all persuasions at the heart level (nearly half a million copies have been sold). The sayings are not intellectual statements so much as themes for further reflection - themes that give deep comfort and encouragement. White Eagle&#39;s gentle words help the reader hear the voice of his or her own heart. Each saying gives guidance on how to bring peace and harmony into our lives. The secret of strength lies in the &#34;Quiet Mind&#34;. This much-loved book of spiritual guidance is now available in paperback.</p><p>White Eagle is the spirit guide of Grace Cooke</p><h2>Basic Rhythmic Training</h2><p>(Instructional).

Even when the Italians do invade, life isn't so bad--at first anyway. The officer in command of the Italian garrison is the cultured Captain Antonio Corelli, who responds to a Nazi greeting of "Heil Hitler" with his own "Heil Puccini," and whose most precious possession is his mandolin. It isn't long before Corelli and Pelagia are involved in a heated affair--despite her engagement to a young fisherman, Mandras, who has gone off to join Greek partisans. Love is complicated enough in wartime, even when the lovers are on the same side. And for Corelli and Pelagia, it becomes increasingly difficult to negotiate the minefield of allegiances, both personal and political, as all around them atrocities mount, former friends become enemies, and the ugliness of war infects everyone it touches. <p> British author Louis de Berni�res is well known for his forays into magical realism in such novels as <i>The War of Don Emmanuel's Nether Parts</i>, <i>Se�or Vivo and the Coca Lord</i>, and <i>The Troublesome Offspring of Cardinal Guzman</i>. Here he keeps it to a minimum, though certainly the secondary characters with whom he populates his island--the drunken priest, the strongman, the fisherman who swims with dolphins--would be at home in any of his wildly imaginative Latin American fictions. Instead, de Berni�res seems interested in dissecting the nature of history as he tells his ever-darkening tale from many different perspectives. <i>Corelli's Mandolin</i> works on many levels, as a love story, a war story, and a deconstruction of just what determines the facts that make it into the history books. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>"Brims with all the grand topics of literature--love and death, heroism and skull-duggery, humor and pathos, not to mention art and religion. . . .

Counting from one to twelve, Sue picks up shells--periwinkle, kittens paw, scallop--and carefully adds them to her bucket as a gift for Grandma. She and her friend identify the shells, and when they discover one that still has the mollusk living inside they put it back in the water--learning that shells are actually the (usually) abandoned homes of sea animals.The paperback edition contains a tear-out shell identification card to enhance the hands-on lesson in simple wonders from nature.</p><p>Formerly an early childhood educator and children&#x2019;s theater director in New York, Marianne Berkes now lives in Florida where she is a children&#x2019;s librarian. "Miss Marianne," as the children at the Palm Beach County Library know her, enjoys telling stories about animals and nature. She also visits local schools where she presents special storytelling programs about the books she has written. Seashells by the Seashore is her third book. Living near the ocean, Marianne enjoys swimming, boating and walking the beach, where she often picks up beautiful shells to add to her collection. <p>The illustrator, Robert Noreika is a watercolorist with a passion for nature and art. He attended the Paier College of Art in Hamden, Connecticut and has his studio in an Arts Center in Avon, Connecticut. He has always loved to comb the beaches and hike in the woods, and now he does so with his wife, Chris, and seven year-old daughter, Sarah. This is the fourth book he has illustrated.</p>Ages 4-7. Through a lyrical counting rhyme, children accompany Sue as she walks the shore, collecting seashells for her grandmother. The rhythmic lines reinforce numbers 1 through 12, while describing individual shells and explaining what shells are and how they came to be on the sandy shore. The strongstroked watercolor art subtly educates, depicting not only the traditional sweep of wide, clean, swimmers' beach but also the rougher edges of the shore. It's along the shore that sea birds prowl alongside Sue, among the large, rough boulders and between the feathers, driftwood, and other ocean debris caught in tangles of dried seaweed and rocks. With each turn of the page, a new shell is discovered, identified, and displayed in the wide left margin. At rhyme's end, the text elaborates on the poem's basic facts, delivering details about each particular shell. A seashell identification chart completes an instructive shell hunt that children will enjoy even if they can't feel the sun on their backs or sand between their toes. <i>Ellen Mandel</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It had opened in 32 theaters on May 25, 1977, and then expanded, slowly, into several hundred more. By the end of July, it was playing in packed houses scattered throughout the United States.<br><br>"To set the scene for this journal and to establish its point of view, I must go back to the summer of 1977," writes Alan Arnold in Once Upon a Galaxy. "I was with a film unit in Greece when reports began to reach us of an extraordinary movie that had taken America by storm. Some of the technicians on location had worked on the film the previous year and were surprised, even puzzled, by these reports. They could not explain the fever developing around what was being called, for want of a better term, a space fantasy, nor the fact that in American cities people were lining the streets for blocks to see it-and going back again."<br><br>"I was making a film in northern Afghanistan," says Robert Watts, production supervisor on Star Wars. "I used to buy Time magazine and Newsweek as it was the only way to keep in touch. I bought my copy of Time one week and opened it straight onto a bunch of color pictures from Star Wars. I thought, Bloody hell! I had no idea it had taken off to such a huge extent."<br><br>"I was walking down Hollywood Boulevard after the film came out," says production illustrator Ralph McQuarrie. "It was still playing at Grauman's Chinese Theatre. The sun was setting and there was a little piece of paper blowing along the sidewalk. I picked it up and saw that it was a bubblegum wrapper with Darth Vader on it. I thought, Gee, now I'm one of those people who make those things. It's part of life now."<br><br>An astronaut at a party told special effects photography supervisor Richard Edlund, "that he believed it all and was glued to his seat."<br><br>"It was a darn good story dashingly told and beyond that I can't explain it," says Alec Guinness, who had played Ben Kenobi. "Failure has a thousand explanations. Success doesn't need one."<br><br>"Star Wars tumbled out in the summer of 1977 and just went cuckoo," says Mark Hamill, who had portrayed Luke Skywalker. "It was like the hula-hoop or Beatles rages. After the film came out, I broke up with my girlfriend for a while. I was like a kid in a candy store. Gee! All these groupies. I don't feel I dealt with that very successfully."<br><br>"When the film came out, I seemed to do publicity for ages, which meant a lot of travel," says Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia). "It was great. But I only get a sense of Star Wars' importance when a child recognizes me and becomes speechless. Kids don't think I'm on this planet. Very little children even believe Princess Leia is a real human being who lives in outer space."<br><br>"What Star Wars has accomplished is really not possible," says Harrson Ford, who had played Han Solo. "But it has done it anyway. Nobody rational would have believed that there is still a place for fairy tales. There is no place in our culture for this kind of stuff. But the need was there; the human need to have the human condition expressed in mythic terms."<br><br>"Millions of people go to the cinema," says composer John Williams. "It's stimulating to hear people whistling your tunes."<br><br>The writer and director of Star Wars, George Lucas, had returned that June from Hawaii, where he'd retreated to escape the work that had dominated his life since 1973. He, too, had been surprised by the film's initial success and was relieved by its perseverance. It seemed more than likely that Star Wars was going to make its money back and then some. While on the island, he hadn't neglected his passion for film and had enticed his friend and fellow director Steven Spielberg to work on another project of his-Raiders of the Lost Ark-which would feature an adventurer-archaeologist named Indiana Jones.<br><br>"I took Francis Ford Coppola to see Star Wars in a regular theater in San Francisco," says Lucas. "That was probably the first time I saw it with a real audience. It was enjoyable, but the thing of it is, by the time you get that far down on a movie, you're so numb and so tired and so emotionally involved that it's very hard to jump up and down and get excited. You feel good, but it's a very quiet kind of thing."<br><br>"When it became a phenomenal success, it was amazing," says Bunny Alsup, assistant to the producer of Star Wars. "I don't think anybody in the world expected it and it was astonishing. Back in the preview days, I remember we were trying to fill a theater with all age groups, so I was personally calling college campuses and asking, 'Would anyone like to go see this movie?'_"<br><br>BADLANDS<br><br>After giving a few interviews, George Lucas stopped doing publicity for the film. It was bringing too many people with scripts to his door asking for money or, occasionally, making threats. The success of Star Wars was already different from the success of his previous film, American Graffiti (1973), inspiring massive emotional reactions domestically and around the world as it opened in foreign markets. It had enormous licensing possibilities and warranted a sequel.<br><br>A follow-up, however, was going to take an enormous amount of work from someone who was in the middle of recharging his batteries. Lucasfilm wasn't a big studio, or even a small studio. It had a makeshift office called Park House, just north of San Francisco in San Anselmo, and-on a parcel owned by the company-a single trailer sitting in a parking lot across the street from Universal Studios in Los Angeles.<br><br>The triumph of Star Wars was a mixed blessing. Making that movie had been a four-year horrific seat-of-the-pants experience-one Lucas never wanted to live through again. But he had always envisioned a grander, very different film from what he'd ended up with, so a sequel would allow him to finish the saga-and to tempt the fates once more.<br><br>"It took so much effort just to get up to speed in order to make the first film and create this great world that I didn't have the time to have any fun, to run around in it," says Lucas. "Now that I know the world and I can see it, it brings up all kinds of ideas and funny moments and adventures. In the first one, you are in a foreign environment-you just don't know what's going on-and it was the same for the author as it was for the audience. So I always felt if I went back to those environments using the same characters, I could make a helluva better movie."<br><br>Several rumors were already extant in the media concerning follow- ups. One source said that two Star Wars sequels had been shot while the first film was being made. The second movie, reportedly, would decide who gets the girl and feature a new battle against Darth Vader and his followers. The third movie would have Ben Kenobi return and try to restore the Jedi Knights so they could combat evil throughout the galaxies.<br><br>Twentieth Century-Fox, the studio that had financed and distributed the film, responded officially that no work had been done on the sequels. Sources also stated that George Lucas wanted only to "supervise" future projects. That part was true. Lucas stated publicly several times that he was retiring from the director's chair. "You end up not being happy anymore and working yourself to death," he says. "Star Wars became a priority; it was one of those things that had to be done: 'But what if something happens to one of the actors? We can't afford to keep the sets around any longer because it costs a lot of money.' It put me in a bad place personally."<br><br>DISAPPEARING MAGIC<br><br>During the summer of 1977, Lucas used the law office of Tom Pollock, Andy Rigrod, and Jake Bloom to begin negotiations with Fox, which had the right of first negotiation and first refusal. Back in 1976, the trio had succeeded in procuring the sequel rights and a 50-50 licensing split for Star Wars. At the time, the studio thought it had given up worthless items, because executives had no faith in the film. Nevertheless, those negotiations had taken more than a year. While Lucas anticipated a much shorter wait this time, he used the bartering period to start organizing his nearly nonexistent company.<br><br>Many potential problems loomed, not least of which was that his visual effects company, Industrial Light &amp; Magic, had ceased to be upon the release of Star Wars. Not a single employee of ILM was on the payroll as of June 1977. Those men and women had of course sought work elsewhere. Many former key members had simply reorganized in the facility's original warehouse in Van Nuys, forming Apogee, whose founding members were: John Dykstra, Grant McCune, Bob Shepherd, Richard Alexander, Alvah Miller, Lorne Peterson, and Richard Edlund.<br><br>"Right after Star Wars came out, there was a period where George didn't know what to do," model maker Steve Gawley says. "He owned the equipment. But in the meantime, he didn't need it, as far as I understand. And so the same group of folks got back together and rented the equipment, and we made a television miniseries for Universal called Galactica."<br><br>"They rented the equipment back to John Dykstra," says model maker Lorne Peterson of the effects supervisor on Star Wars. "And so we were doing Galactica. Dykstra and Apogee ran their group as a cooperative. They all shared in responsibility and shared in profits equally. At least, I think it was equally. I also had my own really small company. We were struggling and then we were also working on Galactica."<br><br>"We got hornswoggled into doing this project with Glen Larson for Universal, the Galactica," says Edlund.<br><br>"Glen Larson came in to ILM, the old ILM in Van Nuys, after George had moved out," says art director Joe Johnston. "But all the people were still there and he hired the entire group, including me, to design, build, and photograph all these visual effects."<br><br>"I left ILM and then it turned into Apogee and they were doing Galactica," says Ken Ralston, assistant cameraman. "I got on two smaller films that never saw the light of day. But I learned a lot during that time, six months on one, that was a disaster! But you have to learn those things."<br><br>While not everyone at the former ILM stayed at Van Nuys-special effects photographer Dennis Muren had departed in March 1977 to work on Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind, which was released in November-the reality was that Lucas was going to have to start a visual effects company for a second time if he wanted to make a second Star Wars. And the Galactica project was going to be a thorn in his side for some time to come.<br><br>BUILDING THE EMPIRE BENIGN<br><br>Before Lucas could even begin to reconsecrate his visual effects team, he would have to form up his corporate headquarters.<br><br>"I was in private practice in San Francisco," says attorney Douglas Ferguson, "and my secretary told me that a fellow named George Lucas wanted to talk to me for business advice. I said, 'I don't know any George Lucas.' And she said, 'You must not be reading the newspapers because he's got a movie out called Star Wars that's a big, big hit.' And that led to a meeting where George came to my office. We got along famously, so we began sketching out the corporate empire that George had envisioned for his company, now that he had the wherewithal to do something."<br><br>Ferguson had been the lawyer for John Korty, another Bay Area filmmaker and Lucas's friend. "Doug did a lot of my personal legal work," says Lucas. "Tom Pollock was my production lawyer. He'd done the legal work and set up a lot of my movies, Star Wars and Graffiti, and the incorporations of my first companies."<br><br>Ferguson would also handle, primarily, the corporate interactions between Lucasfilm and its eventual subsidiaries. One of those, Black Falcon, would eventually take over merchandising and licensing; others would handle movie productions, such as the sequel to American Graffiti, another film already in the pipeline, and Radioland Murders, an ongoing project.<br><br>"The business side of the film industry I don't much like or want to get involved in," Lucas says. "I set down parameters that I want my company to maintain and they reflect my philosophies, my beliefs from when I grew up, which I feel are fairly practical but still basically right. But the corporate environment in Hollywood isn't any different from the corporate environment in the energy business. It's all about making money and it's all about making deals and it's all about screwing this person or that person. It doesn't have anything to do with making movies."<br><br>In addition to his big-picture plans, Lucas was looking for someone who could help run his day-to-day business. "I'd had about 12 years' experience in the film industry in a lot of various capacities," says Jane Bay. "But I wasn't sure that I wanted to continue to work in the film industry because I didn't like what was happening. Basically, the suits were taking over. It was after the decline of the studio system, and the businesspeople were starting to run the industry and I just didn't like the way that it was going. So on the Fourth of July, I called Tom Pollock, a very close personal friend, and said I'm going to be moving to San Francisco. And he said, 'Oh, Jane, I just talked to George Lucas yesterday and he needs somebody to be the office manager for Lucasfilm.'_"<br><br>"Nobody wants to invest in the esoteric craft of visual effects," Lucas says. "You know, just for the sake of doing it. I started a lot of other companies, but that was by accident. I needed to have a sound facility up here. You have to have a place to pre-mix your movies. You don't want to go to Los Angeles to do it, so you start a little sound company. We had to create it all. We were basically carving an industry out of the wilderness here."<br><br>Four days later, Bay went over to Universal Studios. There George had a "little satellite office" not far from Spielberg's where they talked about the state of the film business. "George was telling me that he didn't know if I'd be happy moving to Marin County because he wasn't part of Hollywood and I had this long history in Hollywood in the studios and with independent filmmakers. He said, 'I'm just afraid that you're gonna be bored.' But I just kept saying, 'I left the film industry two months ago to get away from all of it.' So he said, 'Okay, well, you come up to Marin County and see how you like it.' I didn't realize that he had hired me on the spot."</p><h2>Where the Lilies Bloom</h2><p><p><strong>An award-winning novel about the resilience of the human spirit, the power of duty, the fragile relationship between humans and nature, and the sacrifices we make for family.</strong></p><p>Mary Call has promised her dying father to keep her brother and sisters together forever in their home in the Great Smoky Mountains, and to never to take any help from strangers.

Thompson&#x2019;s bestselling <i>Gonzo Papers</i> offers brilliant commentary and outrageous humor, in his signature style.<br><br>Originally published in 1979, the first volume of the bestselling &#x201c;Gonzo Papers&#x201d; is now back in print. <i>The Great Shark Hunt</i> is Dr. Hunter S. Thompson&#x2019;s largest and, arguably, most important work, covering Nixon to napalm, Las Vegas to Watergate, Carter to cocaine. These essays offer brilliant commentary and outrageous humor, in signature Thompson style.<br> <br>Ranging in date from the <i>National Observer</i> days to the era of <i>Rolling Stone</i>, <i>The Great Shark Hunt</i> offers myriad, highly charged entries, including the first Hunter S. Thompson piece to be dubbed &#x201c;gonzo&#x201d;&#x2014;&#x201c;The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved,&#x201d; which appeared in <i>Scanlan's Monthly</i> in 1970. From this essay a new journalistic movement sprang which would change the shape of American letters. Thompson's razor-sharp insight and crystal clarity capture the crazy, hypocritical, degenerate, and redeeming aspects of the explosive and colorful &#x2018;60s and &#x2018;70s.</p><p>In addition to being a testament to the undeniably beatifying properties of American excess--literary, political, chemical, you name it--Hunter Thompson is the high priest of the ad hominem attack. Anyone unlucky enough to get in the way of his satirical sledgehammer will end up with soup for brains. Still, even Thompson needs a good villain to get properly lathered up; that's why he peaked simultaneously with America's 37th president, Richard Milhous Nixon. Tricky Dick was Thompson's dark-jowled, pale-calved Muse, and with his departure Thompson seemed to lose his place a bit. Swatting flies with a baseball bat. <p> You need look no further for this writer's best: this collection of pieces, first published in 1979, spans all of Thompson's primo era, including short pieces and selections from longer works. <i>The Great Shark Hunt</i> sports a few articles filed by a pre-Gonzo Hunter S. Thompson, which show flickers of passion but no real fire; the first experiments with the author's drug-fueled brand of journalism at the Kentucky Derby; and finally the gigs that made him an American institution, in Las Vegas and on the 1972 campaign trail.</p><p> Thompson's style is so unique that a reader is tempted to think that he leapt, fully formed, into Gonzohood. However, along with the crazy, careening prose itself, one of the auxiliary pleasures of <i>The Great Shark Hunt</i> is the map that it gives of Thompson's ascent (or descent, if you prefer) from the workaday hyperbole of sports writing to the hell-blast vigor of his later work. The drugs are, by and large, a distraction--lifestyle points that get in the way of the genuinely perceptive journalism that Thompson created. (But they are there, always, and in quantity.) If you're looking for insight into the underbelly of America, Hunter S. Thompson is your best and only guide, and <i>The Great Shark Hunt</i> is an excellent place to begin the grim safari. <i>--Michael Gerber</i></p>h all its warts, lies naked under the laser-like scrutiny of legendary outlaw journalist and brilliant reporter Hunter S. Thompson. Fearlessly, he hurls himself into each assignment, gouges out the truth, then returns with a fresh story no one else on earth could write. From Nixon to napalm, Las Vegas to Watergate, Carter to cocaine, hippies to himself, Thompson's razor-sharp insight and crystal clarity capture the crazy, hypocritical, degenerate, and redeeming aspects of the explosive and colorful '60s and '70s. Thompson is a rebel and an artist, and we are all richer for it.<br>"No other reporter reveals how much we have to fear and loathe, yet does it so hilariously."<br>-- Chicago Tribune</p><h2>You Are a Goddess: Working with the Sacred Feminine to Awaken, Heal and Transform</h2><p><b>Discover the goddess energies that lie within you and are guiding your life, with the ten goddess archetypes in this book.</b><br><br><b>Discover How the Goddess is Guiding Your Life.</b><br><br>You know 'the Goddess' as a divine feminine figure of myth, art and faith - but are you aware that, in truth, the Goddess is a life force that lives in you?

Although this is not normal, it's not serious if it doesn't lead to inflammation or damage. However, once there's a buildup of simple fat, the liver becomes vulnerable to injury which may result in inflammation and scarring of the liver. Others have what's called Nonalcoholic Steatohepatisis (NASH). Although it is similar to alcoholic liver disease, people with this type of fatty liver disease drink little or no alcohol. NASH can lead to permanent liver damage, as the liver may enlarge and, over time, liver cells may be replaced by scar tissue. This is called cirrhosis. </p><p> Unfortunately both types of NAFLD are becoming more common. Up to 20 percent of adults may have either fatty liver or NASH. One of the most common causes of fatty liver disease is obesity as well as Diabetes Mellitus. More than 6 million children have one of these conditions, which are most common in Asian and Hispanic children. </p><p> Based on the most current and comprehensive information available, the authors have created this indispensable guide for anyone living with and managing fatty liver disease. There is extensive information on the causes of NAFLD, the symptoms and signs, and the treatment options like medications, exercise and diet. Because diet plays such a major role in managing the condition, there are 75 specially selected recipes that contribute to a well-balanced diet that is low in saturated fats and high in fiber. </p></p><p><p> <b>Maitreyi Raman</b>, MD, MSc, FRCPC, is a gastroenterologist and physician nutritionist.

Family members and friends often find themselves unsure of how to weather such a dramatic turn, as the rules and routines of their relationships no longer pertain.<br> <br><i>Everything Changes</i> assuages fears and uncertainty by teaching loved ones of newly recovering addicts how to navigate the often-tumultuous early months of recovery. Beverly Conyers, author of the acclaimed <i>Addict in the Family</i>, again shares the hope and knowledge that she gained as a parent of a recovering addict by focusing on the aftermath of addiction.

Within its pages, you will discover the cause of emotionally impaired families. You will learn how unhealthy rules of behavior are passed down from parents to children, and the destructive effect this process has on our society.<br> <br>Using the latest family research and recovery material in this new edition, Bradshaw also explores the individual in both a family and societal setting. He shows you ways to escape the tyranny of family-reinforced behavior traps--from addiction and co-dependency to loss of will and denial--and demonstrates how to make conscious choices that will transform your life and the lives of your loved ones. He helps you heal yourself and then, using what you have learned helps you heal your family. <br>Finally, Bradshaw extends this idea to our society: by returning yourself and your family to emotional health, you can heal the world in which you live. He helps you reenvision societal conflicts from the perspective of a global family, and shares with you the power of deep democracy: how the choices you make every day can affect--and improve--your world.</p><p>John Bradshaw (1933-2016) has been called "America's leading personal growth expert."

It is a defining characteristic of human nature, without which human nature is not fully human.</i><br> -Abraham Maslow-<br><br> Our lives are limited by our beliefs. In my active addiction, I believed that my life and happiness depended on external forces. I made decisions according to that belief. My false belief led me to make wrong choices. I ultimately created the kind of world I believed in.<br><br> Some years ago I had a great example of how beliefs shape our world view. During the Christmas season I went to the Galleria Mall with a friend of mine and his uncle. The Galleria is the most crowded shopping center in Houston during the holidays. The traffic is terrible. It often takes 40 minutes to get there from my house, which is only six miles away.<br><br> My friend is a warm, loving person. He has an infectious smile. He loves people and <i>believes</i> in their goodness. He was driving the car and we got to the Galleria in 20 minutes. His smile was captivating as he asked people to let us get through traffic lines. He created the kind of world he believed in. <br><br> His uncle wanted to drive on the way back. His uncle is rather somber and believes people are �no damn good.� It took us 20 minutes to get out of the Galleria parking lot! His uncle gave people dirty looks, yelling aggressively at other drivers. No one let him in line. Finally, a sweet little old lady signaled for him to get ahead of her. He shot her the finger! Not only did he create the kind of world he believed in, when data emerged that could change his belief, he refused to look at the data. <br><br> Our beliefs create the kind of world we believe in. We project our feelings, thoughts and attitudes onto the world. I can create a different world by changing my belief about the world. Our inner state creates the outer and not vice versa. It took me 42 years to grasp this rather simple spiritual principle. Co-dependence is at bottom spiritual bankruptcy because co-dependants believe that happiness lies outside of ourselves. <br><br> Stage III starts us on the journey to discover our inner life. This involves the work of spiritual disciplines. Such disciplines demand the same attitude that the previous states involved: resolve, commitment and working one day at a time. <br><br> Just as we needed a sponsor in Stage I and a support group or therapist in Stage II, so also we may need a spiritual director in Stage III. You may find such a person in your new family of affiliation. You may know a spiritual master that you wish to approach and ask to be your sponsor or guide. You may know a pastor, priest, rabbi or spiritual friend whose life and teachings appeal to you. <br><br> Guidance is important in the beginning. Almost no one has been taught how to meditate. Most people continue their childhood methods of prayer and have no idea about expanding their prayer life. Spiritual diaries and journal writing are not common practices for most people. Few people know anything about dream interpretation or dream integration. A spiritual director is most useful in Stage III. <br><br> The 12-Step programs lead us directly to the development of an inner life. The 12-Step programs grew from the six tenets of the Oxford movement. These six tenets were themselves the result of a minister named Frank Buckner�s spiritual experience. The founders of AA were participants in the early Oxford movement in forming their 12-Step program. <br><br> The founders of the AA movement, Bill W. and Dr. Bob, were clear about the ultimate problem of alcoholism. For them it was �spiritual bankruptcy.� This is what I have described as the problem of co-dependency. This <i>ism</i> of alcoholism or any addiction is the inner self-rupture called, variously, internalized shame, self-will run riot or co-dependence. Each is a way to describe spiritual bankruptcy. <br><br> The 12th Step speaks of a spiritual awakening. The 11th Step speaks directly of prayer and meditation. It says: <br><br> <i>We sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understand Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.</i><br><br> The spiritual quest is not some added benefit to our life, something you embark on if you have the time and inclination. We are spiritual beings on an earthly journey. Our spirituality makes up our beingness. We are the kind of spiritual beings who, in order to adequately be spirit, need a body. We are not earthly beings trying to get spiritual. We are <i>essentially spiritual</i>. This is why the abandonment I have described is a spiritual problem. <br><br> If we humans are essentially spiritual, then when we are abandoned, abused or enmeshed, we are spiritually violated. Indeed, when our caretakers acted shamelessly, they were playing God. Healthy shame tells us we are finite, limited and prone to mistakes. When our caretakers acted shamelessly, we were forced to carry their shame. Our self-esteem was wounded by that shame. Co-dependence is the outcome of this abuse. <br><br><br> <p>�1988, 1986.

If you have ever wanted to read a book that validates immortality and communication with loved ones who have passed on, then read this book. It is an authentic portal to the other side." Caroline Myss, author of Anatomy of the SpiritWhen Mike and Beth Pasakarnis received the news that every parent dreads, their world seemed to crumble around them. Spiritual teacher and evidential medium Suzanne Giesemann knew exactly how they felt. Like Mike and Beth&#x2019;s son, Wolf, her step-daughter Susan had been struck and killed by a bolt of lightning out of the blue. Until meeting Mike and Beth, Suzanne&#x2014;a former &#x201c;by-the-book&#x201d; Navy commander&#x2014;had cautiously refrained from using the word &#x201c;proof&#x201d; when speaking of the eternal existence of the soul. But no longer. The evidence Mike and Beth shared from their son provided all the proof she needed. Little did Mike, Beth, or Suzanne know that their lives would soon become even more entangled by unexpected visits from Wolf&#x2019;s spirit. Had Wolf&#x2019;s presence offered a one-time glimpse across the veil, they might still be pondering the significance of the mystifying clues he left behind. Instead, as Wolf repeatedly made his presence known, Suzanne was able to piece together Wolf&#x2019;s puzzle and reveal a startling message that has profound spiritual implications for us all. Travel along on Suzanne&#x2019;s incredible journey as she unravels the web of clues Wolf wove to ensure that his uplifting message of hope and joy is understood by all mankind. "Part spiritual detective story, part definitive proof of after-death communications from a most extraordinary young man, Wolf&#x2019;s Message is above all a must-read for those seeking a more balanced, heart-centered way of living." Kenneth Ring, Ph.D., author of Lessons from the Light&#x201c;Wolf&#x2019;s efforts to communicate with us through Suzanne deserve to be taken seriously and received with gratitude, awe, and celebration.&#x201d; Gary E. Schwartz, Ph.D., author of The Sacred Promise &#x201c;Somehow, reading Wolf's Message creates a field into which the reader is incorporated experientially. Reading, learning, and Being are rolled into a synergy that exemplifies the truths of nature and existence as they are revealed. Such authentic interactivity is rarely achieved in this context; a really good book is one in which the author draws the reader in by chronicling notions and events in such a way as to invite and affirm our ability to relate. A really great story dispenses with the dichotomy of author and reader altogether, and the precious anomaly of Wolf's Message is that it behaves more like an Oracle than a Book.&#x201d; Dr. Barbara E. Fields, Executive Director, Association for Global New Thought</p><p>Suzanne Giesemann is an author, a spiritual teacher, and an evidential medium. A retired U.S. Navy Commander, she served as a commanding officer, as special assistant to the Chief of Naval Operations, and as Aide to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Suzanne&#x2019;s gift of communication with those on the other side provides stunning evidence of life after death. In her work, Suzanne addresses questions about the purpose of life, the nature of reality, and attuning to higher consciousness.

But how can a twelve-year-old girl publish a book? Natalie's mother is an editor for a big children's publisher, but Natalie doesn't want to ask for any favors.<br> <br> Then Zoe has a brilliant idea: Natalie can submit her manuscript under a pen name, with Zoe acting as her literary agent. But it's not easy for two sixth graders to put themselves over as grown-ups, even with some help from a couple of <i>real</i> grown-ups who are supportive but skeptical. The next bestselling school story may be in their hands&#x2014;but can Natalie and Zoe pull off their masquerade?</p><p>Don't mess with Zee Zee Reisman from the Sherry Clutch Literary Agency. Especially when she's promoting the hot new novelist Cassandra Day. New York's publishing scene is familiar with tough players like Zee Zee, and impressed by the book she's pushing... but stunned when they find out Zee Zee and Cassandra are both 12-year-old girls. Zee Zee is really Zoe, fiercely loyal and self-assured best friend to Natalie Nelson, a.k.a. Cassandra Day. When Natalie writes a story, a really good story, Zoe is determined to let the whole world know. Using her formidable wits and all the resources available to a well-to-do New York City girl, Zoe, along with their timid English teacher, Ms. Clayton, proceeds to chip away at the challenge. The catch? The editor Natalie wants happens to be her own mother, an editor at Shipley Junior Books. But Natalie wants her authorship to remain a secret to her mom so that she'll get a fair shake. What ensues is a masterfully elaborate plot to get the manuscript in the right hands--and away from the arrogant, unfriendly editor in chief. <p> A highly original plot with plenty of intriguing side stories makes this a thoroughly satisfying read, especially for future novelists, agents, and editors. The publishing world is explored in just enough detail to gently banish romantic notions, but not to quell enthusiasm. The subplot around Natalie's father, who died four years earlier, is an almost silent but strong undercurrent to the story.

Still, the antinomy of Mars and Venus, of masculine aggression and feminine absorption, of masculine flame and feminine smoldering, is apt when discussing the differences in men's and women's sexual response that underlie all Gray's advice on sustaining satisfying sexual relations. Also underlying his counsel, and making this guide different from many others as well as appealing to the new moral conservatism of the 1990s, are his endorsement of monogamy and his repeated assertion that "great sex is God's gift." In accordance with those emphases, Gray writes not so much of the "mechanics of sex" as of the "mechanics of making sure you have sex," and his chapters bear titles such as "The Joy of Quickies" and "How to Rekindle the Passion" as well as the more expected "How to Drive a Woman Wild with Pleasure." Gray's a plain, even pedestrian, writer, capable of talking about sex in a manner neither lubricious nor clinical, and that capability, along with the title, helps ensure that the half-million-copy first printing HarperCollins has ordered will, as they say, move. <i>Ray Olson</i></p><h2>Sunstone Book One</h2><p>Two women deal with modern themes of sex, relationships, and fetishism in this erotic romantic comedy.

While we love talking about starts and finishes, the middle miles are more important, seldom discussed, and wildly misunderstood.<br>You survive the middle by enduring the valleys, and you thrive by optimizing the peaks. You will find your way only by reconciling what you learn from others with what you discover on your own. You'll get lost. At times, you'll lose hope. But if you stay curious and self-aware, your intuition and conviction will be your compass.<br>While difficult to withstand and tempting to rush, the middle contains all the discoveries that build your capacity. The middle is messy, but it yields the unexpected bounty that makes all the difference.<br>Introduction<br>When I set off to write a book about the middle of bold projects and entrepreneurial journeys, you might expect that I started with my own. Having endured five years "bootstrapping" my own business and facing my fair share of challenges as an entrepreneur, this was my chance to share everything I learned. But I couldn't remember anything. It wasn't memory loss-it was just all a big blur.<br>So I turned to the common source of answers to random ponderings these days: my phone. I flicked through years of random photos taken, back to the middle years of building Behance, my first company, hoping to jog my memory. I founded Behance in August 2006 and signed the documents to be acquired by Adobe in December 2012, so I made my way to 2009 on my phone, the absolute middle of my middle. Thousands of thumbnail images showed screenshots taken on my phone of website errors, bad copy, social media mentions of us and competitors, and various product ideas and changes. These screenshots spanned years and, in some months, outnumbered my photos. The sheer volume of them reminded me of falling asleep every night scrutinizing our product, anxiously looking for something but never knowing exactly what.<br>I also found another type of screenshot-customer messages and feedback. I remember capturing these insights to share with my team, but also I needed them. I wanted to hold on to and extend some early semblance of reward and significance at a time when nobody seemed to care.<br>Scrolling a little farther, I saw a reunion with college friends and then a special moment from my honeymoon during which my wife and I encountered elephants in Thailand. I was surprised to see how strained my smile looked. The memory rushed back, and I recalled the tension of wanting to relish this once-in-a-lifetime moment while realizing I had a team at home running on fumes and I was just a few months away from missing payroll. Being away from the team felt utterly irresponsible, and this burden followed me everywhere. Scrolling farther now, I stumbled on a team event at a restaurant kitchen where we all cooked a meal together-we couldn't afford it, but I knew the only thing that mattered was keeping the team together. As I scrolled through our team pics, I was struck by how close and dedicated we became despite the circumstances and our differences. When the odds are against you, without revenue or margin to protect you, teams and relationships are different. It's not work; it's survival and self-discovery.<br>These photos reminded me just how exhausted and uncertain I had been-fueled by my relentless determination to make something awesome. Perhaps, in such periods of struggle, our preoccupations and emotions take up so much mind share that the events themselves become a blur? Or perhaps we don't remember the middle because we don't want to?<br>You�re probably reading this book because you�re about to embark on a massive journey-or are already trekking through the middle of one. Whether you�re a writer, start-up entrepreneur, big-company innovator, or an artist, you share many of the same hopes and fears.<br>You might be working within a multinational company, a small nonprofit, a new creative studio, or on your own. No matter what it is you're trying to create or transform, the myth of a successful journey is that it starts with the excitement of an idea, followed by a ton of hardship, and then a gradual and linear rise to the finish line.<br>But no extraordinary journey is linear. The notion of having a bold idea and making consistent incremental progress is impossible. Those seeking a linear journey with less instability can still be successful, but they often struggle to create anything new.<br>In reality, the middle is extraordinarily volatile-a continual sequence of ups and downs, expansions and contractions. Once the honeymoon period of starting a new journey dissipates, reality hits you. Hard. You feel lost and then you find a new direction; you make progress and then you stumble.<br>Every advance reveals a new shortcoming. Major upsets give rise to new realizations that lead to breakthroughs in progress. At best, you move two steps forward, one step back-at worst, you realize you've been walking the wrong path entirely for months. This is what that journey actually looks like.<br>I've come to call the journey of creation one of "relative joy." Your job is to endure the lows and optimize the highs in order to achieve a positive slope within the jaggedness of real life-where, on average, every low is less low than the one before it, and every subsequent high is a little higher. In the moment, you can see only the uphill or downhill in front of your nose, but over time, you come to recognize that there is a median that keeps you moving forward in the right direction.<br>The volatility of this tug-of-war is hard to stomach. You must pay less attention to the day-to-day incremental advances and more on achieving an overall positive slope. And that's entirely determined by how you navigate the messy middle.<br>It's not about the start and finish, it's about the journey in-between.<br>There are just a handful of thrilling and treacherous moments as an entrepreneur. Most of them happen at the start or finish of the journey (or one of the restarts or false finishes along the way). They're all we talk about, but they reveal very little about the journey itself.<br>We love talking about the starts.<br>The start is romantic. We love talking about it because it is inspiring without the complication of substance and strife. Conception is an adrenaline rush fueled by grandiose visions paired with naivety. You're inspired by a destination and have no idea how you'll get there. The solution in your mind's eye is rose colored. You don't yet know how the cards are stacked against you.<br>In this case, ignorance is not only bliss but also enables you to dream up solutions at the edge of reason. You're untethered.<br>We also love talking about finishes.<br>We imagine the rush, the exhaustion, and the pride of finally making it. This is what we dream of throughout the struggle of creating, isn't it? How relieved we'll be when the workout is finally over. A "finish" can happen at different parts of a journey: Launching a product. Publishing a book. Raising money. Reaching a key milestone. Being acquired. Shutting down. Going public. Closing the quarter. The press likes to write these headlines and we like to read them. But the superlatives obscure the fact that they are simply abstract mile markers. We learn very little from these moments despite their gravity.<br>One of the strangest parts of being an entrepreneur is being part of a community obsessed with starts and finishes. Investors tend to be interested only in starts (when they're able to invest) and finishes (when they get a return). Similarly, stories tend to be written only about public inflections. Even between entrepreneurs or big company CEOs, what is intended as a network of support becomes an echo chamber. Nobody wants to talk about their self-doubts and the insecurities that fuel them. Every business is "going great" until it fails. The bumps along the road are endured in isolation. The majority of the journey itself is unchronicled because it is unappealing and too revealing.<br>As a young entrepreneur, the focus on starts and finishes always bothered me. As a manager, I sought to hire people who were seeking a journey rather than a particular outcome. The more immersed I became in the start-up world, the more I wanted to operate without sensationalism. When the journey feels gritty and real, your potential becomes more tangible.<br>Then I went to work as an investor with dozens of entrepreneurs at all different stages of company building, where it became clear how destructive the spotlight on starts and finishes really is. As we celebrate the success of others, we're liable to draw lessons from a drastically edited story that excludes the middle. What's in the middle? Nothing headline-worthy yet everything important. Your war with self-doubt, a roller coaster of incremental successes and failures, bouts of the mundane, and sheer anonymity.<br>The middle is seldom recounted and all blends together in a blur of exhaustion. We're left with shallow versions of the truth, edited for egos and sound bites. Success is misattributed to the moments we wish to remember rather than those we choose to forget. Worst of all, when everyone else around us perpetuates the myth of a straightforward progression from start to finish, we come to expect that our journey is meant to look the same. We're left with the misconception that a successful journey is logical. But it never is. Don't let others' stories pervert your understanding of the journey. Emulating someone else's story is following a playbook without all the pages in the middle.<br>We don't talk about the messy middle because we're not proud of the turbulence of our own making and the actions we took out of despair. Sharing our challenges shakes our egos. And finally, the middle of a journey doesn't make for good headlines.<br>The middle isn't pretty, but it is illuminating and full of essential realizations to finish whatever it is you set out to start. It's time we start talking about it.<br>The journey to create a product or service is reflected in the outcome in ways you may not even expect. It matters, tremendously.<br>Consider a product you use in your everyday life-is it simple or complicated? Too many features or just the functionality you need? Is it enjoyable or is it a chore? The experience of using someone else's creation comes from the path the creator took to make it. It is not the plastic, metal, or pixels that make a successful product or service. Rather, it is the thoughtfulness and tough choices made by the makers-the team dynamic, the perseverance, the organizational design (and redesigns), the constraints, the battles fought, and the values that governed the path taken.<br>This book is about mining every insight from the volatility and the depths of despair to improve your team, product, and self. This book is also intended to help you survive the creative process when you lack any sense of traction, recognition, or significance.<br>A few years ago I set out to understand what founders and other leaders of bold new projects do throughout their journeys that they don't talk about. I sought to chronicle the pain-management techniques, the tactics for optimizing, and the instincts that not only help their teams survive the journey from start to finish but also thrive.<br>This book is the culmination of seven years' worth of scribbled notes, mobile memos captured on the run, and one-liners committed to memory. It covers insights witnessed and realized in boardrooms, on midnight calls with teams solving a crisis, during sleepless nights fretting difficult decisions, in brainstorming sessions with entrepreneurs, and often in the reflective haze of long-haul plane flights. The perspectives in this book are derived from experiences with many different people and teams, from entrepreneurs to writers from small agencies and start-ups to billion-dollar companies transforming their industries. When a tactic or tenet fascinated me, I'd capture it and share it with others for feedback or better ideas, and the ones that made the cut are in this book. The following pages cover insights garnered from interviews, from my own struggles and relative triumphs, and from working alongside the many entrepreneurs I have advised over the years. While the insights are organized into sections, the book is intended to be more of a buffet than a plated six-course meal. I encourage you to navigate to whatever parts of the journey resonate most at the moment, using the table of contents.<br>As they have for me, I hope these insights bolster your confidence, fortify your plans, and make you question your assumptions. As you seek to make an impact in what matters most to you, this book will help illuminate your path from start to finish.<br>The stories fall short<br>In 2006, I founded Behance, a company devoted to connecting and empowering creative professionals. The problem my team and I set out to solve was a simple one: the creative world was one of the most disorganized communities on the planets-there was no way to track a photographer's work, find out who designed a particular product, or track down the motion graphics artist or creative director behind a particular campaign. We wanted to help organize creative people, teams, and the community at large.<br>The problem was simple, but the solution was anything but. After several fits and starts, lessons learned the hard way, and five years of bootstrapping (building a business that relied on revenue rather than venture capital), we built a multifaceted business. The Behance Network grew to enable more than twelve million creative professionals to showcase their work, connect and collaborate with one another, and get jobs. Over the years, Behance became the leading online platform for creative careers and provided me with the opportunity to grow a large design and technology team. We then expanded Behance by offering content and events for the creative community, online and off, by creating a think tank, website, and annual conference called 99U in 2007. Influenced by the famous Thomas Edison quote, "Genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration," 99U is dedicated to the execution of ideas rather than the ideas themselves.<br>In late 2012, Behance was acquired by Adobe, one of the world's largest technology companies responsible for products like Photoshop, Illustrator, and the PDF (Portable Document Format), among many other products for the creative world. It was an incredible and unexpected outcome for the entire team-certainly not the one I imagined for myself when I started designing paper products and running seminars for freelance designers to pay the bills. I joined Adobe as a vice president of products, leading an overhaul of the company's mobile and cloud asset strategies. The three years that followed were enlightening in ways I didn't expect. I had to wind down old products, help launch new ones, and lead teams through a great deal of uncertainty and change. I left this role with an appreciation for the frictions in a big company-how they hurt, how they help, and how to keep the ship moving forward, inch by inch.</p><h2>Fancy Nancy and the Mermaid Ballet</h2><p><p><strong>*NOW A HIT TV SERIES ON DISNEY JUNIOR*</strong></p><p><strong>From the dazzling bestselling duo Jane O&#x2019;Connor and Robin Preiss Glasser</strong> <strong>comes a fancy, frilly ballet story with a lot of heart.&nbsp;Young ballerinas and Fancy Nancy fans&nbsp;will shout encore!</strong></p><p>Fancy Nancy is ready for the spotlight!

When it comes to children, some of my favorite to treat are what I call inflexible kids. These kids can be extremely bright and high functioning in many ways. They have an almost uncanny ability to learn and memorize new information-it just seems to burn into their brains. But information retention is also the root cause of their difficulty. Because the cognitive associations they form are so strong, they can't be altered very easily. Once these kids experience something, that's it: A template forms, and they have a hard time adapting to even slight deviations. The inflexible kids I see glom on to structure, routine, and predictability. They must go to their restaurant, dress the way they're used to, sit in class where they've always sat. When life doesn't happen as they expect, they can't handle it. I call them "need to know" kids, as opposed to "go with the flow" kids. They perceive the world as black or white, good or bad, their way or no way, and nothing in between.<br><br> One inflexible kid I treated, eleven-year-old Susan, was an all-American girl who loved to play hockey and sent me pictures of her team every season. Susan's parents described her as strong willed, capable, and very intelligent, a great kid in most respects. She'd never had serious behavioral problems before. As Susan's mother told me, "About 85 percent of the time, she's a rock star. She's queen of the monkey bars, a strong swimmer and skier, a great gymnast, and a great hockey player." During the other 15 percent, Susan fell into fits of anger. "It's like a switch gets flicked," her father told me. "She'll yell at her sister or hit her. Does the same with her mom. She'll scream, 'I hate you; you're not the boss of me! You can't make me! Don't look at me! Don't touch me!'"<br><br> As bad as these tantrums might sound, in the world of challenging behavior, they're pretty minor. Susan wasn't violent. She didn't harm herself or others. She was coping well enough at school. Frankly, she didn't seem that hard of a case.<br><br> For the first several weeks of working together, we made progress in helping her parents understand how she was wired and how this wiring led to some of her challenging behavior. Susan seemed to enjoy coming to our sessions, and we forged a strong therapeutic relationship. It helped that her parents loved her and were bent on doing whatever it took to help their daughter.<br><br> Then on Susan's first day of middle school, her parents called and said they needed to see me-Susan was in crisis. I was able to fit her in that day, right after lunch. But that wasn't soon enough. I was out grabbing a bite when I received a frantic text from my office: "Your one p.m. appointment is here. They need you!"<br><br> I ran back to the office to find Susan in hysterics. Her father was physically restraining her, and her mother was holding her shoes. As her mother told me, she had taken them so that Susan wouldn't launch herself through a plate-glass door and run away. "Susan, what happened?" I asked. She refused to speak to me. This was unlike her. We had developed such a solid relationship.<br><br> It took a good twenty minutes, but we managed to calm her using techniques I'll describe later in this book for dealing with people in crisis. Susan still wouldn't speak, but she would write words and phrases down on pieces of paper. Meanwhile, her parents relayed what had happened. Susan didn't want to go to school, and her parents had been trying to force her. Even her beloved grandfather couldn't manage to coax her into going. She had run away, and when she was brought back home, she said she wanted to kill herself. This was entirely out of character. She might have always had minor anger issues, but she never exhibited any explosive or suicidal behavior before. What could possibly be going on here?<br><br> It turned out that at overnight camp a few weeks earlier, Susan had suffered severe migraines and wasn't able to reach her parents by phone. The experience traumatized her. Now, as Susan confirmed through the phrases she was writing, she didn't want to go to school because she was deathly afraid she would get another migraine and not know whom to go to or what to do. She feared she would freak out as she had at camp, and the other students would stare at her and think something was wrong with her.<br><br> When I uncovered these concerns, they made perfect sense. As her parents and I had discovered, Susan struggled with cognitive skills related to flexibility. She needed more routine, planning, and predictability than other kids, and when these elements were lacking, she ran into trouble. Like other inflexible kids, Susan especially struggled with transitional situations in which existing templates didn't apply and she was forced to adapt to new conditions. Attending middle school for the first time was such a situation, and it made sense that Susan would have trouble with it. Everything in middle school was different from what Susan was used to: the kids, the lockers, the schedule, the teachers, the building itself-everything. If she got a migraine, she wouldn't know what to do. She had no template, no plan to follow. Susan got so upset and anxious that she didn't know how to express her feelings to her parents. All she could do was lash out. And her parents, who would otherwise have jumped to help her, didn't know what to do.<br><br> For many years, Susan's parents had interpreted her temper tantrums as a technique she used to get her way. Most parents would probably have come to a similar conclusion. Like Susan's parents, they would have dealt with Susan's behavior by punishing her, setting boundaries, and "teaching her a lesson." But in this instance, Susan clearly wasn't being difficult because she wanted to be. Her anxieties about a brand-new school and the possibility of getting a migraine there tied into her cognitive makeup, and the more her family tried to force her to go to school, the more explosive she became. Her well-intentioned parents were trying to force their inflexible child to do something she wasn't capable of doing. And that inflexible child, lacking the cognitive skills to deal with the situation and come up with a solution, did the only thing she could. She acted out.<br><br><b> Get Out of Line, Do the Time</b><br><br> Our society has an entrenched way of thinking about behavior. We almost always assume it derives from a person's will-that people behave consciously and purposefully. When people misbehave, we likewise assume that they're doing it intentionally. As a result, whenever individuals in almost any social setting act out or misbehave, those in charge usually respond by punishing the bad behavior. When you were a kid, did your parents take away your TV time or allowance when you misbehaved? Most did. When you continued to misbehave, they probably just stepped up the intensity of the consequences and rewards. And they probably also bestowed privileges when you did the right thing.<br><br> School discipline is similar. We assume that when kids misbehave in school, they do it on purpose either to get stuff (special attention, for instance) or get out of stuff (like doing their work or coming inside after recess). In the early school years, teachers punish kids with time-outs. They are taught that kids will use the time away from their peers to reflect on what they did wrong, and that they will feel badly enough at missing out and having been punished that they will want to behave better next time. As kids grow older, schools hand out detentions and suspensions that likewise isolate the offenders and are supposed to teach them a lesson. Statistically, these are the most common punishments in U.S. schools, and I should add that they are also levied disproportionately on kids with disabilities and those of color. All along in our educational system, we assume that people misbehave deliberately, and that reforming behavior means simply providing the right motivation.<br><br> When kids really act out and become uncontrollable, we remove them from mainstream schools and put them into therapeutic schools or treatment centers, and, eventually, juvenile detention facilities. Later, we lock them away in adult prisons (I'll have more to say about this progression, which has been called the "school-to-prison pipeline"). These institutions also usually operate according to principles of punishment and reward. In some states, the law mandates very specific punishments for offenses by inmates at detention centers. In some facilities where I have worked, for instance, lying to staff, arguing when given instructions, or disrespecting others can result in punishments like loss of privileges, early bedtimes, time-outs, and extra work assignments. Staff can reward good behavior by bestowing extra privileges such as more TV time, more time playing sports, and later bedtimes. Serious offenses, like possessing weapons or threatening staff, can prompt more serious punishments, like placement in a restricted program or even transfer to a different facility.<br><br> The treatment patients receive at most psychiatric hospitals is similarly organized. Virtually all psychiatric hospital care in the United States takes place within structured systems of discipline called point and level systems, token economy systems, or contingency management systems. The institution marks progress in treatment by defining different levels that patients can attain. Behave well, and you bump up to higher levels, receiving more privileges (TV time, movies, special meals, home visits, and so on). When you sustain the highest level long enough, the institution will discharge you. But if you behave poorly, you slide down to lower levels, losing privileges. We assume that this carrot-and-stick approach will motivate people with psychiatric illnesses to behave better. Implicit in this assumption is that they've lacked the willpower in the past to behave well. People misbehave, we think, because they want to.<br><br> These practices, however, aren't reserved for people with serious emotional and behavioral disorders. Companies, governments, and entire countries deploy this approach to discipline in an attempt to shape behavior. Did you land a big client or make your numbers? Your boss may give you a bonus or promote you. Did you fail to follow protocol or get another unsatisfactory performance review? Your boss may place you on probation, demote you, or even fire you. Governments try to encourage "good" behavior (like going to college or saving for retirement) by offering rewards such as tax incentives. They discourage "bad" behavior (like polluting or violating workplace regulations) by levying higher taxes, slapping on fines, or providing for civil lawsuits. In foreign policy, we place sanctions on countries that flout international law, and we reward countries for good behavior by lifting sanctions, giving them privileged trading arrangements, and offering their leaders photo-op meetings with our president.<br><br> We persist in assuming that if we institute proper consequences, teaching offenders the benefits of behaving well and the costs of misbehaving, they will make better choices and mend their ways. We can trace this thinking back to the Bible and the vengeful God in the five books of Moses who levies harsh punishments onto the Children of Israel for their misdeeds. More recently, twentieth-century behavioral science has seemed to confirm the wisdom of punishments and rewards. Experimenting with rats, researchers found that by manipulating rewards and punishments they could encourage or discourage simple behavior. Like rats, human behavior is an age-old matter of conscious choice and free will-nothing more. Or so it might seem.<br><br><b> Learning from a "Bad" Kid</b><br><br> But what if this thinking is wrong? What if people don't misbehave because they want to, but because they lack the skills to behave otherwise? As we'll see in the next chapter, a large body of neuropsychological research has disproved the notion that poor behavior is a choice, and it has affirmed the idea that skill determines good behavior. In fact, research in the neurosciences has identified dozens of specific, underlying skills that if absent or diminished result in challenging or "bad" behavior.<br><br> As compelling as this research is, you don't need science to understand that people do well if they can, not if they want to. During my senior year in high school, when I first became interested in psychology, I got a job at a hospital psychiatric unit for kids. This locked facility admitted kids for short-term stints when they threatened to harm themselves or others. I was supposed to hang around and observe at first, but the unit was grossly understaffed. Almost immediately, staff asked me to help take care of patients in ways I never expected and, frankly, was not trained for.<br><br> During my first week, staff members and I were supervising patients on the playground when a twelve-year-old boy-I'll call him Jason-had an explosive outburst. I ran over to lend a hand as the other staff members tried to calm him. Jason broke free and did the unthinkable: He kicked me and spit right into my face. One of the staffers, who was serving as my mentor at the facility, saw this happen. "Hold on," he said. "Let me teach you a few things about what to do here."<br><br> He grabbed Jason, turned him around, and showed me how to restrain him. He placed his arms around Jason's body, forming them into a kind of straitjacket. Meanwhile, he stood between Jason's legs so that the kid could not kick him backward.<br><br> Jason's outburst and the violence of the restraint unnerved me. But I was in for much more. A few hours later, Jason exploded again and was restrained. Jason was really out of control, so staff members forced him into a seclusion room and placed him facedown on a cold floor. One of the staff members sat on his back to hold him down, and they motioned for me to hold his legs. I did so for several minutes, and it wasn't pleasant. Jason was screaming, crying, writhing, spitting, and calling me and my mother all sorts of names.<br><br> Soon Jason ran out of energy and fell asleep on the floor. We, too, were drained. And I found myself struggling with competing feelings. I felt uncomfortable and ashamed to be helping-it seemed crude to me, inappropriate, wrong, as if I were inflicting still more suffering. Yet I felt empowered to be able to help with something so critical. I didn't say anything to the other staff about my ambivalence. They were the experts, and I figured that as painful as it was, restraining Jason was probably necessary or helpful. We were just doing what needed to be done.</p><h2>Developing Female Leaders</h2><p><p><strong>How to More Effectively Leverage the Leadership Gifts and Abilities of Women in Your Church </strong></p><p>What would your church look like in the future if it were to maximize the dormant gifts of the women God has brought there?

Weeman&#x2019;s own escape from the dark vortex of drug and alcohol addiction is proof positive that the sacraments can transform earthly sobriety into heavenly sanctity." --<b>Patrick Coffin</b>, Author and host of <i>The Patrick Coffin Show</i></p><h2>�Estamos en un libro!-An Elephant and Piggie Book, Spanish Edition</h2><p>Gerald is careful.

From fanciful backgrounds for Disney classics such as&nbsp;<i>Sleeping Beauty</i>&nbsp;to bold experiments in multimedia art, from ambitious commercial animations to lush and otherworldly oil landscapes, Earle's oeuvre never fails to please the eye and engage the imagination. And here, collected in&nbsp;<i>Awaking Beauty</i>&#x2014;the official catalog for the 2017 Walt Disney Family Museum exhibition of the same name&#x2014;is a definitive exploration of his life's full work.<br><br>Born in New York City in 1916, Earle showed early talent, hosting his first solo exhibition at the age of fourteen. After traveling in Mexico and Europe as a teenager, he bicycled across the United States, painting watercolors to pay his way. In the late 1930s, he began designing Christmas cards&#x2014;which have sold more than 300 million copies over the years&#x2014;while continuing to exhibit his fine art.<br> <br>Earle's transformative moment, however, came in 1951, when he was hired at The Walt Disney Studios as a background painter. Again, he proved a quick study, lending his talents to the Academy Award-winning short&nbsp;<i>Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom,&nbsp;</i>beloved full-length feature&nbsp;<i>Sleeping Beauty,&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;and many other time-honored Disney animated films.<br> <br>After his tenure at Disney ended in 1958, Earle turned his attention to commercial animation and advertising, then returned ot fine art full-time in 1966. Here, in the last three decades of his life, Earle created an immense and impressively varied body of work. He became an expert at the silkscreen-printing process known as serigraphy, a painstaking art form that could require up to 200 individual screens. He also created dozens of graphic and arresting scratchboards&#x2014;engravings carved into boards primed with white clay and black ink&#x2014;for his autobiography,&nbsp;<i>Horizon Bound on a Bicycle</i>. In addition to his multimedia experiments, Earle painted dazzling oil works of the natural world, capturing the rolling hills, lacy and voluminous trees, and crashing blue waves of California in a nearly transcendental light. A moving and lyrical writer, he often accompanied his mesmerizing landscapes with equally meditative and intriguing poems.<br> <br>After a long and esteemed career, Earle passed away in 2000 in Carmel-y-the-Sea, California, leaving behind a formidable legacy in animation and fine art. Today, his work is in the permanent collections of several prominent museums (including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York), while his memory continues to inspire new generations of aspiring creatives around the globe.</p><p>The Walt Disney Family Museum in San Francisc, California, presents the fascinating story and achievements of Walt Disney, the man who raised animation to an art, transformed the film industry, tirelessly pursued innovation, and created a global and distinctively American legacy. Located in the scenic Presidio of San Francisco, the museum is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization founded by Walt's daughter Diane Disney Miller. The cutting-edge facility opened in October 2009 and features contemporary, interactive galleries with state-of-the-art exhibits narrated in Walt's own voice alongside early drawings, cartoons, films, music, a spectacular model of Disneyland, and more.&nbsp;<i>Awaking Beauty: The Art of Eyvind Earle</i>&nbsp;is the eighteenth original special exhibition created by The Walt Disney Family Museum.<br> <br>&nbsp;</p><h2>The Dandelion Seed: A Life Cycle Nature Book for Kids (Plants For Children, Science For Kindergarten)</h2><p>A dandelion can teach much about seeds and seasons and cycles, and the big world that a wind-blown seed can travel, but it also can make us appreciate the challenges it must overcome.

Hitomi learns of the rich man's sudden passing and creates a desperate plan. He fakes his own death, digs up and hides the other man's body, and then washes himself up starving on a beach near the home of the dead man's family. After successfully impersonating the now-dead son, Hitomi takes over all aspects of the industrialist's life, including his company, his fortune, and eventually his wife. The failed author soon redirects the family's wealth to his own perverse aims.<br><br>A graphic novel based on the revered novella by Edogawa Rampo. Rampo was the godfather of Japanese pulp mysteries. Stunning artwork by master manga artist Suehiro Maruo deftly illustrates this Japanese pulp classic in fine detail.<br>* 13th Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize for New Artist</p><p>Born on January 28, 1956 in Nagasaki. At a young age, Suehiro Maruo was an avid reader of comic. magazines such as &#34;Shonen King&#34; and &#34;Shonen Magazine,&#34; and aspired to become a manga artist. At the age of 15, Maruo moved to Tokyo and look a job at the bookbinder Toppan in Tokyo. At 17, he showed his work to edito&#34; at &#34;Shonen Jump&#34; but was told his work wasn&#39;t appropriate for their adolescent readers. After this, Maruo took a hiatus from attempting to publish his comic work. Suehiro Maruo made his debut as manga artist at the age of 24, with his work &#34;Ribon no Kishi.&#34;Cult manga artist Maruo delivers a sprawling and nightmarish tour de force of erotic fantasy. Adapted from the 1920s novella by Japanese author Edogawa Rampo&#x2014;a popular detective novelist who took a Poe-esque turn toward the grotesque and fantastical&#x2014;Maruo follows the story of Hitomi, a desperate would-be novelist who tries to turn his life around by taking advantage of his strong resemblance to Komoda, the recently deceased son of a wealthy industrialist. After digging up Komoda's corpse and tearing out a tooth and replacing it with a fake one from Komoda's corpse, Hitomi poses as the dead man returned with surprising ease. The dreamlike quality of the narrative intensifies as the imposter announces he will use his new family's industrial power and wealth to build a glorious paradisiacal retreat on a nearby island. This quixotic quest will be as baffling to readers as to his advisors. But once Maruo delivers the island itself, its otherworldly beauties and wonders make up for any plot deficiencies. Maruo's debt to the erotic-grotesque (ero-guro) school of manga is apparent throughout, with inexplicable turns of plot alternating with stabs of extreme violence and boundary-pushing sex. As in Poe's most memorable work, the only rules of logic this story follows are its own.

If a prayer was answered, everyone was happy that God moved. If a prayer had no impact, we were told it was for some greater purpose. Can you identify? I could too, but as I refused to settle, God met me at my point of need. As a result of a long journey with God to help people get set free, thousands of testimonies, and the tools found in my books, I have demonstrated to people around the world that prayer can be different. The missing key is often the right language applied properly to the mechanics of the spirit. This book is a collection of advanced prayers that do just that. This is the sequel to Prayers That Shake Heaven and Earth. Picking up where the former left off, it is the upgrade you have been waiting for.Advanced Prayers That Shake Heaven and Earth is not a teaching tool, but a collection of prayer resources. Furthermore, it is a sequel, meaning that this book is an addendum to Prayers That Shake Heaven and Earth. This book is divided into three sections in order to help you navigate your way through it. You will find general prayers, ministry prayers, and prayers requiring activation. In the general prayers section, you will find prayers to connect with Jesus, to clear an atmosphere spiritually, and even to successfully engage in territorial warfare with 23 distinct keys, among other things. In the ministry prayers section, you will find high-powered deliverance prayers capable of securing freedom from constellations, the kabbalah tree, walk-ins, and even the synthetic kingdoms. In the prayers requiring activation section, you will find prayers that utilize the arche, the star, and the mountain, which are elements of our inheritance in Jesus Christ that many believers have never accessed before. It is advised that the user first complete the higher-level courses found at the BRIDE Ministries Institute (wwwbrideministriesinstitute.com) before deploying these prayers in their ministry. These prayers allow for the destruction of evil spiritual realms, the unraveling of evil timelines, and even the correction of subquantum formulas and equations, among other high-level exploits.</p><p>Daniel Duval is the Executive Director of BRIDE Ministries International and BRIDE Ministries Institute.

One summer morning, the cub heads out to play. He hears someone in the tree and thinks it might be his friend Mouse. But Mouse arrives and eliminates that possibility. So begins the guessing game that makes up the rhyming text as, page by page, the various woodland animals come on the scene narrowing the choices of the creature's identity. The refrain And the Bear asks, 'Who?' gives readers a heavy-handed clue, but not until the end does this shy newcomer make his appearance. Chapman's acrylic illustrations are as soft and cuddly as ever and the familiar rhythm works well for reading aloud. While this isn't the strongest of the titles, Bear's many fans won't want to miss it.<i>&#x2013;Julie Roach, Cambridge Public Library, MA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She was on line at Bouchon, the newly opened French bakery that was around the corner from her Rockefeller Center office.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jay voo-dray un pan chocolate. Make that deux.&#x201d;<br> <br>The cashier smiled patiently as she waited for the young woman to string together her next request. Clearly she was accustomed to these clumsy attempts by customers to practice their French, even though the bakery was in the heart of New York City.<br> <br>Laurie wasn&#x2019;t feeling quite as patient. She was meeting with her boss, Brett Young, later this morning and still hadn&#x2019;t decided which story to pitch first for her show&#x2019;s next special. She needed as much time as possible to prepare.<br> <br>After a final &#x201c;mare sea,&#x201d; the girl left, a box of pastries in hand.<br> <br>Laurie was next. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be ordering in anglais, s&#x2019;il vous pla�t.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Merci,&#x201d; the woman said fervently.<br> <br>It had become a tradition that on Friday mornings she would stop at the bakery and bring in special treats for her staff&#x2014;her assistant, Grace Garcia, and her assistant producer, Jerry Klein. They were grateful for the selection of tarts, croissants, and breads. After she placed the order, the cashier asked if she cared for anything else. The macarons looked delicious. Maybe just a few for Dad and Timmy after dinner, she promised herself, and as a treat for me if today&#x2019;s meeting with Brett goes well.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>As she stepped from the elevator on the sixteenth floor of 15 Rockefeller Center, she realized how the layout of the Fisher Blake Studios offices reflected the success of her work this past year. She used to be in a small windowless office, sharing an assistant with two other producers, but since she had created a true crime&#x2013;based &#x201c;news special&#x201d; focusing on cold cases, Laurie&#x2019;s career had taken off. Now she had a long row of windows in a spacious office filled with sleek, modern furnishings. Jerry had been promoted to assistant producer and occupied a smaller office next door. And Grace kept more than busy in a large open space just outside. The three of them now worked full-time on their show, Under Suspicion, freeing them from other run-of-the-mill news programming.<br> <br>Grace had recently turned twenty-seven but looked even younger. Laurie had been tempted more than once to tell Grace she didn&#x2019;t need to wear all of the makeup she meticulously applied every day, but clearly Grace preferred a personal style quite different from Laurie&#x2019;s classic tastes. Today, she wore a multicolored silk tunic over impossibly slim leggings, with five-inch platform boots. Her long black hair was pulled into an I Dream of Jeannie topknot, teased into a perfect fountain.<br> <br>Usually Grace lunged for the bakery bag, but today she did not. &#x201c;Laurie,&#x201d; she began slowly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Something wrong, Grace?&#x201d; Laurie knew her assistant well enough to recognize when she was upset.<br> <br>Just as Grace was about to explain, Jerry stepped out of his office. Standing between Jerry&#x2019;s long, lanky frame and Grace in her sky-high heels always made Laurie feel short, even though she was a slender five-foot-seven.<br> <br>Jerry held up both palms. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a lady sitting in your office. She just showed up. I told Grace to schedule an appointment for her at some other time. For the record, I had nothing to do with this.&#x201d;</p><h2>Foraging the Mountain West: Gourmet Edible Plants, Mushrooms, and Meat</h2><p>Foraging the Mountain West: Gourmet Edible Plants, Mushrooms, and Meat<br><br> There's food in them thar hills!

So when Roy Disney, chairman of Walt Disney Animation and nephew of founder Walt Disney, abruptly resigned in November 2003 and declared war on chairman and chief executive Michael Eisner, he sent shock waves through the entertainment industry, corporate boardrooms, theme parks, and living rooms around the world&#x2014;everywhere Disney does business and its products are cherished.<br><br>Drawing on unprecedented access to both Eisner and Roy Disney, current and former Disney executives and board members, as well as thousands of pages of never-before-seen letters, memos, transcripts, and other documents, James B. Stewart gets to the bottom of mysteries that have enveloped Disney for years: What really caused the rupture with studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg, a man who once regarded Eisner as a father but who became his fiercest rival? How could Eisner have so misjudged Michael Ovitz, a man who was not only &#x201c;the most powerful man in Hollywood&#x201d; but also his friend, whom he appointed as Disney president and immediately wanted to fire? What caused the break between Eisner and Pixar chairman Steve Jobs, and why did Pixar abruptly abandon its partnership with Disney? Why did Eisner so mistrust Roy Disney that he assigned Disney company executives to spy on him? How did Eisner control the Disney board for so long, and what really happened in the fateful board meeting in September 2004, when Eisner played his last cards? <br><br><i>DisneyWar</i> is an enthralling tale of one of America&#x2019;s most powerful media and entertainment companies, the people who control it, and those trying to overthrow them. It tells a story that&#x2014;in its sudden twists, vivid, larger-than-life characters, and thrilling climax&#x2014;might itself have been the subject of a Disney classic&#x2014;except that it&#x2019;s all true.</p><p>James Stewart has done it again. The author of the mega-bestselling <i>Den of Thieves</i>, about the 1980s insider-trading scandals on Wall Street, and <i>Bloodsport</i>, the 1990s tale of the Clintons' Whitewater affair, now gives us another epic story, this one culminating in late 2004. With <i>DisneyWar</i>, Stewart turns his investigative and storytelling lens on Michael Eisner and the corporate intrigue which has overtaken the Walt Disney Company in the last decade. He explains how this once-proud institution, long one of America's most admired and well-known businesses, has stumbled in recent years amid a disastrous swirl of egos, personalities, and bad business decisions.<p> Like one of the roller coasters at DisneyLand, Stewart's epic book takes readers through a wild up-and-down ride as it describes Eisner's regime as CEO. The tale begins with Eisner's early successes rejuvenating Disney's live-action movie franchise and theme parks, the kickoff of the modern animation era with blockbuster hits like <i>The Lion King</i> and <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>, and the cultivation of a highly talented cadre of lieutenants, which reads like a Who's Who of executive talent now dispersed across the Fortune 500: Stephen Bollenbach (Hilton Hotels), Steve Burke (Comcast), Geraldine Laybourne (Oxygen Media), Richard Nanula (Amgen), Joe Roth (Revolution Studios), and so on. Stewart makes clear that Eisner has had a major eye for strong creative content himself, both as a young executive in his pre-Disney years at ABC and at Paramount Pictures and more recently in building partnerships like Disney's extremely lucrative one with Pixar.</p><p> Just as he credits Eisner for various Disney successes, though, Stewart assigns blame for the failures, too. The thoroughly researched 534 pages of <i>DisneyWar</i> make clear that his overall verdict on the CEO is negative. Much of the book describes detailed and specific interactions between Eisner and his rivals. Readers interested in the entertainment industry or in the personalities which drive it will not be disappointed. The blow-by-blow accounts of Eisner's feuds with Dreamworks SKG founder Jeffrey Katzenberg, who was his chief aide for nearly two decades, and Michael Ovitz, the superagent from CAA who had been friends with Eisner for even longer than that, are amazingly detailed. They show Eisner to be creative, funny, and charming when he wants to be--and devious, dishonest, and horribly Machiavellian when he doesn't. </p><p> Though dispassionate in his writing, Stewart assembles a withering portrait of Eisner as a grasping, self-centered, manipulative, and ultimately self-destructive executive. He shows how the Disney CEO has consistently undercut his potential successors within the company, in many cases drawing on Eisner's own writings and conversations with board members. He shows how Eisner's erratic attitude towards paying severance to former employees--in some cases being overly stubborn (as with Katzenberg, to whom he had a chance to close out for $90 million, but whom Disney ended up paying $280 million) and in others being shockingly lenient (as with Ovitz, who received a $140 million golden parachute after one relatively ineffective year at the company). He shows the overreach of grandiose projects like Euro Disney, and the missed opportunities like <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, <i>Sopranos</i>, and <i>Survivor</i>, on all of which Disney passed.</p><p> In the end, Stewart has returned with <i>DisneyWar</i> to what he does best: drilling into a murky and complex subject, capturing an enormous amount of detail through personal interviews, emails, memos, court records, and other data sources, and then weaving together a rich tapestry of people and events to bring others to the same conclusions he has clearly reached himself. Though some readers might tire of the reams of detail Stewart offers--at certain points, the book reads like a gossip rag, with intricate he-said, she-said accounts of individual meetings--most will enjoy it. Beyond the entertainment value, this book also has serious value to students of corporate governance, as it presents a scathing portrait of Disney's captive board of directors and shows what happens with the lack of proper CEO oversight. <i>--Peter Han</i></p>James B.

He did things his way and was often at odds with his superiors in the Minneapolis Police Department. Since those early days, Davenport has mellowed a little, and his background as a computer game-designing, Porsche-driving womanizer has been somewhat reduced. Possibly age has become a factor, or it may be the fact that Davenport has been deputy chief since the sixth book in the series, <i>Night Prey</i>. The character may have changed, but the writing has remained consistently taut: the bad guys creepy, the mysteries suspenseful.<p> In this newest episode, Davenport is called to a house after an A-list party has taken place there. Alie'e Maison, a top model, has been found strangled, and evidence shows that she ingested drugs and recently made love--most probably to a woman. Before Lucas leaves the house, things get even more complicated: a second body is found stuffed in a closet with a deep dent in the skull. In addition, one of Lucas's own men had been at the party and is now a suspect. </p><p> As always, Lucas's own life is not exempt from complications. An ex-lover comes back into his world--a woman he has never been able to forget--and she has secrets of her own. Also making an appearance this time out is a childhood friend to whom he turns for advice about women and life. Sister Mary Joseph, born Elle Kruger, is a professor of psychology and one of the computer brains who helps Lucas design his software. He calls her Nun the Wiser, and he often turns to her for spiritual as well as more concrete advice. Lucas is going to need all the help he can get to unravel his case as secrets pile upon secrets and the ground constantly shifts under his feet. </p><p> <i>Easy Prey</i> is another powerful link in this chain of muscular, exciting thrillers by one of the most distinguished practitioners in the field. <i>--Otto Penzler</i></p><b>John Sandford</b>&nbsp;is the pseudonym for Pulitzer Prize<b>&#x2013;</b>winning journalist John Camp.

Season with butter [sic] and salt; When cold spread between slices of bread. Good for school lunch.<br> <br>&#x2014;Los Angeles Times Cookbook, No. 2, 1905<br> <br>Until recently, I never considered making my own peanut butter. Skippy was good enough for me.<br> <br>Until recently, I never considered buying a frozen peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I hadn&#x2019;t even known such a thing existed. I first read about Smucker&#x2019;s popular frozen peanut butter sandwich&#x2014;the Uncrustable&#x2014;in a New York Times Magazine article by (of course) Michael Pollan. He wrote, &#x201c;People think nothing of buying frozen peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for their children&#x2019;s lunch boxes.&#x201d; I thought: They don&#x2019;t? What people? What frozen peanut butter and jelly sandwiches? What&#x2019;s next, frozen buttered toast?<br> <br>I felt briefly smug in the certainty that I was not so lazy or compromised that I would ever buy mass-produced peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Then I thought, People probably once said that about peanut butter. And bread. And jelly. They almost certainly said it about waffles, and pie crust, and pudding. Not so long ago, people must have wondered who couldn&#x2019;t fry her own donuts, grind her own sausage, cure her own bacon. Kill her own bacon! The more I thought about it, the more arbitrary it seemed to draw a line in the sand at the frozen PB&amp;J.<br> <br>Yet drawing and redrawing just such arbitrary lines had become one of my primary preoccupations in recent years. The most irksome decisions I faced as an adult and working mother seemed to be made at the supermarket. Fundamentally trivial, they were nonetheless maddeningly fraught, involving questions of time, quality, money, First World guilt, maternal guilt, gender, meaning, and health. I had only to step through those automatic Safeway doors for the nattering mental calculations to begin: Owen needs cupcakes for school and look, here they are, ready to go, packed in clamshells. Nutritionally irredeemable&#x2014;but made. Sixteen dollars for twenty-four supermarket trans-fat packed cupcakes? Good grief. I&#x2019;ll bake. That means I need eggs and the eggs here sure are cheap. But I can&#x2019;t buy them here because these eggs are laid by debeaked chickens living in cages the size of Tic Tac boxes. If only I&#x2019;d gone to the farmers&#x2019; market on Sunday and bought eggs there ... But how do I know that guy treats his chickens well just because the eggs are blue? And honestly, do I even really care about chickens? I can&#x2019;t believe I&#x2019;m spending three dollars per pound for these crunchy tomatoes. I should grow them, just like Barbara Kingsolver. How does she find the time to make her own cheese and breed her own heritage turkeys and write books? I need to work harder, sleep less, never watch TV again. Wait, there&#x2019;s high-fructose corn syrup in Campbell&#x2019;s vegetable soup? Isn&#x2019;t that supposed to be a deal breaker?<br> <br>Every choice I made was loaded, and every choice I made was wrong. The mental conversation was circular and chronically irritating and I couldn&#x2019;t seem to shut it down.<br> <br>Then I lost my job.<br> <br>Instantly, I was stabbed with the predictable financial anxiety, which I attended to by taking an overdue video back to the video store and calling my husband to make sure that he still had his job. It was 2008 and a lot of people were losing their jobs. I made myself a cup of tea and walked out the back door of our house and sat on the steps leading down to our unkempt suburban yard, strewn with deflated soccer balls and broken deck chairs and gravel. The sky had fallen, yet there it was, vast and blue above me. A few end-of-the-season red apples weighted down the branches of our tree. I thought, I should really pick those, before the squirrels get them. I can make applesauce. I can make apple butter. I can make chutney. Who needs a job when you have an apple tree? They didn&#x2019;t have jobs in Little House in the Big Woods.<br> <br>Even as I thought this, sitting on my steps, I knew it to be completely ridiculous. A job is more valuable than an apple tree. People can&#x2019;t live on applesauce and no one even likes chutney. Plus, I hate canning.<br> <br>And yet a question lodged in the forefront of my mind. Where is that sweet spot between buying and making? What does the market do cheaper and better? And where are we being deceived, our tastes and habits and standards corrupted? Could I answer this question once and for all? I didn&#x2019;t want an answer rooted in ideology, or politics, or tradition, or received wisdom. I wanted to see the question answered empirically, taking into account the competing demands&#x2014;time and meaning, quality and conscience, budget and health&#x2014;of everyday American family life.<br> <br>And so, over the next months and years, I got some chickens, which I loved; and some ducks, which I loathed; and some turkeys, which we slaughtered. I learned to make cheese and keep bees and worried that the neighbors were going to call Animal Control. I cured bacon and salmon, canned ketchup, baked croissants, and made vanilla extract and graham crackers. I planted tomatillos and potatoes and melons and squash. My son, Owen, joined 4-H and practically moved into the yard, while my teenage daughter, Isabel, refused to step outside the back door at all, especially after the goats turned up. My husband, Mark, rolled his eyes at all of it except the homemade yogurt. That, he ate by the quart. At the height&#x2014;or maybe it was the depths&#x2014;of my homemaking experiment, I had pickles lacto-fermenting on the counter and seven varieties of jam, ranging from banana-chocolate to plum, arrayed in the pantry, and absinthe and Taleggio cheese mellowing in the crawl space behind my closet. I was overwhelmed and a bit of a mess, but I had my answers.<br> PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY SANDWICH<p></p> <br>Let&#x2019;s get back to the PB&amp;J. One day, I bought some Uncrustables, the Smucker&#x2019;s frozen sandwiches, which come in a carton decorated with a quaint gingham check. Then I made a peanut butter and jelly sandwich the usual way, which took less time than finding the car keys to drive to buy the Uncrustables. Unwrapped, Uncrustables do not look like sandwiches, but like dainty white turnovers with sealed, crimped edges. They look wonderful, the bread downy and soft and white as a stack of Kleenex.<br> <br>I took a bite. The jelly was gelatinous and supersweet, as in a jelly donut, one of my favorite foods. I loved it. The second bite was less delightful&#x2014;a bit cloying and yet oddly desiccated. By the third bite, I was done. This was a stupid little sandwich.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s like the peanut butter is a solid mass,&#x201d; said Isabel, then twelve years old, plucking out a flat shard of tan paste and holding it up for inspection. &#x201c;Look, it&#x2019;s a thing.&#x201d;<br> <br>The homemade peanut butter and jelly sandwich, on the other hand, was luscious and sloppy and extravagant and fresh, and it easily carried the day. If this is the best Smucker&#x2019;s can do, I thought, civilization is safe.<br> <br>I assumed that the Uncrustables would turn out to be a bargain. Isn&#x2019;t the whole point of industrial food that it is cheap? Well, cheap to make, maybe, but not all that cheap to buy. This fact has repeatedly taken me by surprise, though it probably shouldn&#x2019;t have. Inferior mass-produced food often costs more&#x2014;and sometimes quite a bit more&#x2014;than homemade food. The homemade sandwich cost fifty-one cents and was roughly twice the size of the wee Uncrustable, which priced out at sixty-three cents.<br> <br>There is market research that answers the question of who buys these expensive sandwiches when it is so easy and inexpensive to make one at home. Just to show how loaded this subject of food can be, how much socioeconomic and gender baggage we attach to the shopping and production of what we eat, I&#x2019;ll describe the &#x201c;research&#x201d; that I performed in my own brain while standing in my kitchen. Who buys Uncrustables? I saw a woman in a peach velour tracksuit with a Kate Gosselin haircut loading up her cart at a big-box supermarket. She appeared pouty and spoiled and indolent, someone who would recline on the sofa watching Real Housewives and eating fat-free bonbons rather than make her kids&#x2019; sandwiches. A mother who buys Uncrustables: bad mother.<br> <br>Then I tried to picture a man buying a box of Uncrustables. He came to me just as instantly and fully formed. A widower, he pushed a cart through the IGA after a long day of honest toil, perhaps in the construction trade. He wore a rumpled flannel shirt and looked a lot like Aidan Quinn. He was noble and long-suffering, a devoted dad, out there shopping for his kids&#x2019; food when he deserved to put his feet up and crack open a cold one. He needed to meet a really nice woman, someone just like me, except single.<br> <br>I thought this. I was appalled at myself.<br> <br>PEANUT BUTTER<br> <br>Until I actually did it, I thought you had to be compulsive and controlling to grind your own peanut butter. But it turns out to be almost as worthwhile as making your own PB&amp;Js. (Though not quite.) Home-ground peanut butter is nubbly, rich, intensely peanutty. Mass-market brands like Jif and Skippy have been sweetened and homogenized to the point where they resemble peanut-flavored Crisco. I still love Jif and will almost surely buy it again, but homemade is better next time you have seven minutes to spare.<br> <br>Make it or buy it? Make it.<br> <br>Hassle: Scant<br> <br>Cost comparison: Per cup, homemade peanut butter is 80 percent the price of Jif.<br><br>1 pound unsalted roasted peanuts, shelled and skinned<br> <br>2 tablespoons oil (preferably peanut)<br> <br>Salt<br><br>1. Put the peanuts and oil in a food processor or blender and grind until you have a creamy paste. Add more oil if necessary to thin. Make this peanut butter a little thinner than you think it should be, as it will firm up a lot in the refrigerator.<br> <br>2. Salt to taste. Store in a jar in the refrigerator for several months.<br> <br>Makes 2 cups<br> <br>Now what about the bread? What about the jelly? What about all of it?<br> <br>A few caveats before we get started. First, although, like most people, I think about money, I&#x2019;ve always been able to clothe my children and pay the mortgage and if I couldn&#x2019;t, whether I bought or made cr�me fra�che&#x2014;or bread, to use a less absurd example&#x2014;would make no difference. It is frivolous and deluded to think it would. I just wanted to address and answer some middle-class home economics questions that nagged my Michael Pollan&#x2013;reading, price-checking, overthinking self. This is not a book about how to scrape by on a budget and it is not a book about how to go off the grid.<br> <br>Second, prices of food vary from day to day, shop to shop, region to region. I did my best to price ingredients consistently and accurately as of late 2010 and early 2011, but the prices you see here might not always reflect what you pay, where you live, today.<br> <br>When I started this project I had a lot of time on my hands&#x2014;more than I&#x2019;d ever had before as an adult. A lot of these projects are very ambitious, and I&#x2019;ve tried to make clear which are particularly time consuming. But when you&#x2019;re exhausted and overworked, even the simplest kitchen job&#x2014;even mixing a jar of salad dressing&#x2014;can seem like too much. When I say &#x201c;make it,&#x201d; I mean that when you have the time and the inclination, the recipe in question is something you can do better, and/or more cheaply, than the supermarket. By no means do I think everyone should make all (or even any) of these foods, all of the time. I sure don&#x2019;t.<br> <br>Moreover, if you don&#x2019;t enjoy messing around in the kitchen, you probably aren&#x2019;t going to end up making your own Camembert and pancetta, despite the fact that they&#x2019;re better and cheaper than what you can buy. Nor should you. As my son, Owen, said one day&#x2014;a little spitefully&#x2014;while he was reluctantly doing his homework and I was happily stuffing pot stickers, &#x201c;Mom, I think if you didn&#x2019;t like to cook we&#x2019;d eat canned soup every night.&#x201d;<br> <br>He is right.</p><h2>Kiss The Sky (Calloway Sisters)</h2><p><p><strong>A virgin "ice queen" heiress &amp; </strong><strong>The arrogant god-like man who wants to melt her</strong></p><p> <br> Rose Calloway thought she had everything under control.

After its "discovery" by Captain Cook in the late 18th Century, Hawaii was fought over by European powers determined to take advantage of its position as the crossroads of the Pacific. The arrival of the first missionaries marked the beginning of the struggle between a native culture with its ancient gods, sexual libertinism and rites of human sacrifice, and the rigid values of the Calvinists. While Hawaii's royal rulers adopted Christianity, they also fought to preserve their ancient ways. But the success of the ruthless American sugar barons sealed their fate and in 1893, the American Marines overthrew Lili'uokalani, the last queen of Hawaii.</p><p>James L. Haley's<i> Captive Paradise</i> is the story of King Kamehameha I, The Conqueror, who unified the islands through terror and bloodshed, but whose dynasty succumbed to inbreeding; of Gilded Age tycoons like Claus Spreckels who brilliantly outmaneuvered his competitors; of firebrand Lorrin Thurston, who was determined that Hawaii be ruled by whites; of President McKinley, who presided over the eventual annexation of the islands. Not for decades has there been such a vibrant and compelling portrait of an extraordinary place and its people.</p></p><p><b>JAMES L. HALEY</b> is a critically acclaimed historian and biographer. His books have been praised by <i>Publishers Weekly</i> who called <i>Passionate Nation: An Epic History of Texas</i> "Outstanding." <i>USA Today</i> called his book <i>Wolf: The Lives of Jack London</i> "fascinating," and <i>The</i> <i>Wall Street Journal</i> said that Haley "surpasses Irving Stone."<p>1. The Loneliness of a God</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>After rounding the southern tip of the island, Cook&#x2019;s ships headed north up the western side. About thirty miles on, a small bay opened up on their right, about a mile across that bit half a mile into the coast. On the south shore lay a beach;1 the east side vaulted steeply up to a beetling precipice several hundred feet high that sheltered the bay from the trade winds. Its face was so inaccessible that its caves held the bones of generations of kings, and the natives called it <i>Pali Kapu o Keoua</i>, the Sacred Cliff of Keoua, after the dynastic founder. Then it descended on the north shore to a lava shelf just above the water, as low and flat as a wharf. <i>Resolution</i> and <i>Discovery</i> entered Kealakekua Bay and dropped anchor in seven fathoms of turquoise water.</p> <p>Within moments a throng of thousands teemed on the shore, and the people raced out in their canoes to discover what manner of gods had come to visit them, and what gifts they had brought. &#x201c;Cook,&#x201d; wrote Ledyard, &#x201c;ordered two officers into each top to number them with as much exactness as they could.&#x201d;2 Both counts exceeded three thousand canoes in the water, with as many as six natives in each, with more thousands of people on the shore, rejoicing. Overall, Cook made a rough guess that between 350,000 and 400,000 natives inhabited the entire archipelago&#x2014;a number that, interestingly, has stood as a sensible midrange figure in a scholarly debate over the size of the precontact population, figures that have ranged from 200,000 to more than 1 million.3</p> <p>But of the three thousand canoes knifing toward him, Cook was not alarmed, for he knew the Polynesians to be fulsome, festive people. Women swarmed on board to give themselves to these godlike creatures; they chanted their intentions, reinforced with stunningly suggestive hula, as recorded by twenty-eight-year-old ship&#x2019;s surgeon David Samwell, of the <i>Discovery</i>:</p> <p><i>Where, oh where</i></p> <p><i>Is the hollow-stemmed stick, where is it,</i></p> <p><i>To make an arrow for the hawk?</i></p> <p><i>Come and shoot.&#x2026; </i></p> <p><i>A penis, a penis to be enjoyed:</i></p> <p><i>Don&#x2019;t stand still, come gently,</i></p> <p><i>That way, all will be well here,</i></p> <p><i>Shoot off your arrow.</i>4</p> <p>Leaving behind the mass mating on his ships, Cook was rowed ashore in his pinnace; chiefs who accompanied him motioned the crowding canoes aside with long white poles&#x2014;necessary because three thousand canoes in less than one-half square mile of water, and then crowding about Cook, created an unmanageable confusion. Ashore, &#x201c;as they passed through the throng, the chief cried out in their language that the great Orono [Lono] was coming, at which they all bowed and covered their faces with their hands until he was passed [<i>sic</i>].&#x201d;5 To Ledyard&#x2019;s consternation, Cook made a joke of the natives&#x2019; groveling: Having prostrated themselves, they rose once he went by and stared after him; then Cook would spin around and face them again, forcing them to fall to the ground once more. Cook was feted with the best that the islanders had to offer, although as a god, he could not be troubled by having to chew his own food. He was attended by chiefs, who reverently chewed the food for him and placed the masticated wads in Cook&#x2019;s mouth, which he managed to swallow. Contrary to the Captain Cook cult fostered by his officers, Corporal Ledyard was mortified by what he saw, and in later years American missionaries who heard the story from old natives blamed Cook darkly for his hubris in accepting their homage as a deity, which, they declared, made him responsible for his own looming disaster.</p> <p>After preliminary contact was made, and with suitable advance preparations, Cook returned the courtesy and welcomed aboard Kalaniopu&#x2018;u, the king of Hawai&#x2018;i Island, an old man, noticeably not as huge as other chiefs of his class, wizened and palsied from years of consuming <i>&#x2018;awa</i>, a native hallucinogen.6 Among the king&#x2019;s gifts to the god was an <i>&#x2018;ahu&#x2018;ula</i>, a feather cloak that featured vivid geometry in red, black, and yellow; such cloaks were the epitome of the islands&#x2019; handicrafts. The king removed the cape from his own shoulders and placed it on Cook&#x2019;s, then removed also his matching feathered helmet, his <i>mahiole</i>, and gave it as well; perhaps a half dozen more cloaks were laid at Cook&#x2019;s feet, gifts of stunning value. The rarest feathers were the yellow; the bird from which they came, the <i>&#x2018;o&#x2018;o</i>, was jet black, with a single yellow feather beneath each wing. Professional birdcatchers harvested the yellow feathers and released the birds to regrow them. It would have been difficult for Cook to realize the wealth that was offered at his feet.</p> <p>Accompanying Kalaniopu&#x2018;u onto the <i>Resolution</i> was his son and heir, Kiwala&#x2018;o, and a representative sample of the young <i>ali&#x2018;i.</i> The most striking of them, to British sensibilities, was the king&#x2019;s nephew. A massive young man, he was variously described as from six feet four inches to seven feet in height. Heavyset and to Western eyes ugly, he was intense, brooding, with the thick, downturning mouth of the Polynesian, a low, prominently ridged brow, and heavy-lidded eyes. He was aloof, observant, his every glance seeming to be an appraisal. His name was Kamehameha, which in its full iteration meant &#x201c;the Loneliness of a God.&#x201d;</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>Because of a variety of factors&#x2014;his destiny to forge the modern Hawaiian kingdom, the fact that his own early history took place before the advent of written records, and the modern scholarly contest over control of the narrative&#x2014;Kamehameha&#x2019;s early years are impossible to piece together with certainty. Sources equally probative differ beyond reconciliation, but within wide latitude general features are known:</p> <p>King&#x2019;s nephew he may have been, but it was a miracle that Kamehameha had lived to see this day. He was born on the Kohala Coast at the northern point of the island, and shortly thereafter the <i>kahunas</i> laid the noble infant on the Naha Stone, a three-and-a-half-ton block of lava, to divine his royal worth: If he cried, he would be tossed out to the common people to share their miseries; if he was silent, then truly he was an <i>ali&#x2018;i</i>, born to rule. The baby did not cry, and he was given the name Pai&#x2018;ea, meaning &#x201c;hard-shelled crab&#x201d;; an important <i>kahuna</i> prophesied that he would one day overturn the chiefs of Hawai&#x2018;i and rule the entire island. This, the priests saw with consternation, the baby had the lineage to do, and in Hawaiian culture, bloodline was everything. His mother, Kekuiapoiwa II, was an important chiefess of the Kohala district, and he had two fathers&#x2014;a condition known as <i>po&#x2018;olua</i> (two heads). In this polyamorous culture, paternity could be shared among a woman&#x2019;s husband and lovers, and of these two Kahekili was king of Maui, and Keoua (who had placed his ancestors&#x2019; bones in the caves above the bay) was the grandson of the last chief to nearly unite the island of Hawai&#x2018;i.7 Kamehameha himself preferred to claim Keoua as his father, and after his rise to power he made it treason&#x2014;and death&#x2014;to question it, perhaps reason enough to suspect Kahekili.8 Keoua&#x2019;s father and uncle were defeated in battle by an insurgent chief named Alapa&#x2018;i, who took the surviving orphans into his own clan. Pai&#x2018;ea, therefore, was born into the extended family of the king, but because of his lineage and the dangerous prophecy, Alapa&#x2018;i placed the baby under a death sentence.9</p> <p>The danger was real, for infanticide was accepted, though not common among the chiefs.10 Most often it was imposed on babies produced by a chiefess but gotten of a father too low in rank for the elders to accept as her mate. This was a different case, as it concerned not just social disapproval but a prophesied overthrow of the king. Kekuiapoiwa could not openly defy Alapa&#x2018;i, but the women of Hawai&#x2018;i were renowned for their shrewdness. She determined to save her baby by resorting to the custom of <i>hanai</i> adoption. Hawaiian <i>ali&#x2018;i</i> almost never raised their own children; families of high rank strengthened their ties by each handing over newborns to be raised by relatives, and accepting others&#x2019; babies in return. The practice may have been a holdover from still more warlike days, when hostages were traded to ensure a peace; certainly it provided security for the children of a war-riven country to have two sets of parents, and in this instance it saved the infant Pai&#x2018;ea&#x2019;s life. His mother sent him out for <i>hanai</i> to another noble family beyond the reach of Alapa&#x2018;i&#x2019;s assassins. Five years later the king withdrew the condemnation and sent for the child to be raised in the royal court. Already a suspicious loner, the boy was renamed Kamehameha, and as such he spent his youth, training as a warrior in traditional weapons and tactics.</p> <p>In the arts of war he had a tutor, Kekuhaupi&#x2018;o, under whom he mastered the traditional weapons of the islands: the bloodcurdling twelve-foot spears, and the ability to dodge one, snatch it from midair, and launch it back toward the enemy; the war clubs studded with sharks&#x2019; teeth, and the <i>pahoa</i>, the double-bladed dagger that could stab both left and right. His agility he honed by rolling through the town balanced on a rounded lava boulder (still preserved in a local museum), an astonishing feat for a man of his height.</p> <p>When old Alapa&#x2018;i died about 1754, the island of Hawai&#x2018;i was thrown into civil war. In this culture all land belonged to the king. The high chiefs held their domains as his vassals, and under them the chiefs (and chiefesses, for in this society genealogy trumped gender and women could be very powerful) held their parcels of land, called an <i>ahupua&#x2018;a</i>. This was usually a wedge of an island from highest peak to shore. Whether by accident or design, this form of landholding allowed most of the chiefs to be largely self-sufficient, for the average <i>ahupua&#x2018;a</i> contained all the productive topographies of an island, from tidal fishponds and irrigated taro fields to upland crops and forest. Commoners were not tied to the land like European serfs, but that was virtually the only distinction between their status and that of the peasants of medieval Europe. Whichever chief&#x2019;s <i>ahupua&#x2018;a</i> they lived on, they were allowed to keep only perhaps a third of all that they produced&#x2014;fish, taro, fruit, <i>tapa</i> cloth.11 The other two-thirds they handed up the hierarchy, to the chief, the high chief, the king, and the <i>kahunas</i> who placated the gods. In addition, <i>kanakas</i> had to hold themselves in readiness to serve as the chief&#x2019;s warriors when he called for them. It was all very feudal, a system that Norman barons would have recognized, except in one important respect: There was no expectation that a chief&#x2019;s land tenure would survive the king. Once a king died, his successor held the right to redistribute all the land as he pleased. When there were rivals for the throne, as there almost always were, chiefs and high chiefs curried favor and struck alliances with contenders who would bestow the most favorable lands on them. Thus, more often than not a king&#x2019;s death occasioned a bloodletting free-for-all.</p> <p>Kalaniopu&#x2018;u whom Cook greeted was Alapa&#x2018;i&#x2019;s great-nephew, and had not been in the line of succession but became king by conquest. Kamehameha was too young to have taken part in this war, but as he matured into the fearsome warrior he was acknowledged to be by the time of Cook&#x2019;s arrival, he would have been indispensable in quelling later rebellions against Kalaniopu&#x2018;u&#x2019;s rule. Nor were the circumstances of Kamehameha&#x2019;s fortuitous birth forgotten, and he was installed third in importance after the king and his son Kiwala&#x2018;o. But second in line was not as good as inheriting the kingdom. Kalaniopu&#x2018;u was old, Kamehameha was ambitious, and once the kingship was vacant he would have to fight his cousin to establish his own rule.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>Now aboard Cook&#x2019;s ship, as the others traded and visited, Kamehameha could not conceal his wonder at the ship&#x2019;s weapons. Their superiority over native spears and war clubs was stupefying. Iron to the Hawaiians was almost a legendary substance. They knew that it existed, for they had acquired small pieces of it&#x2014;strong, malleable, extremely useful&#x2014;from the drift of shipwrecks and, it seems likely a few times over the centuries, storm-driven Japanese fishing vessels whose survivors became assimilated into the population. But before Cook&#x2019;s arrival they had no dependable source of it. And here on this white men&#x2019;s ship were huge weapons&#x2014;cannons&#x2014;made of iron, which seemingly weighed as much as the Naha Stone. The chief who could gain possession of such weapons, and master them, could conquer the entire island. The British did not need to know of Kamehameha&#x2019;s birth prophecy, because his covetous rapture over their big guns shouted his ambition all too loudly.</p> <p>The islanders&#x2019; avidity for iron, and their desire to know how to work it, was such that Cook had the <i>Resolution</i>&#x2019;s forge brought on deck, and the blacksmith fashioned implements before the astonished natives&#x2019; eyes. Cook also observed a telling aspect of the culture: The chiefs wanted the iron for themselves: &#x201c;If a common man received anything, the chief would take it. If it was concealed and discovered the man was killed.&#x201d;12 When Cook requested a place on land to establish a camp to note down astronomical data, the chiefs, believing him to be Lono, were quick to offer him the Hikiau <i>heiau</i> on the south shore, since the temple was dedicated to him anyway. Cook established the scientific station there with a guard of marines; the chiefs laid a <i>kapu</i> against women approaching the sacred ground, but the sailors and the marine guard had no disposition to turn away the women eager to offer pleasure to these exotic men. The chiefs withdrew the <i>kapu</i> to save face, but were displeased that Lono&#x2019;s retainers would defile their own temple. &#x201c;It was the beginning,&#x201d; wrote Ledyard, &#x201c;of our subsequent misfortunes, and acknowledged to be so afterwards when it was too late to revert the consequences.&#x201d;</p> <p>Another disquieting incident occurred when William Watman, one of the <i>Resolution&#x2019;s</i> gunners, suffered a stroke, requested to be buried ashore, and died. The natives had not suspected that one of the god&#x2019;s attendants could die, albeit he was not the god himself. They accorded him a mighty funeral within the limits of the Hikiau <i>heiau</i>, heaping the grave with flowers and sacrificed pigs. But their awe of the English began to disintegrate. Soon after, William Bligh instructed about fifty Hawaiians to haul <i>Resolution</i>&#x2019;s rudder, which had been taken on land for repair, back to the shore. Their response to being ordered about was typically Hawaiian. As Ledyard noted, they took up the rope, &#x201c;and pretended to pull and labor very hard, though at the same time they were in fact doing all they could to retard the business, to ridicule and make their pastime.&#x201d; Bligh, as he later became famous for doing, responded by beginning to beat them, but was stopped by a chief; Bligh demanded that the chief make his people help. The chief then joined his people, who &#x201c;laughed at him, hooted him, and hove stones.&#x201d;13 Ledyard sought permission to arm his detail and ran to assist Bligh, but it was the English sailors who eventually hauled the rudder back to the <i>Resolution</i>; the <i>kanakas</i> had had enough of them.</p> <p>After a stay of eighteen days, Cook sailed the ships away to find a better anchorage on Maui; happy to be rid of him but still thinking that he might be a god, the Hawaiians sent him off with ceremonies fit for the divine. But then on February 4 gale-force winds cracked...</p></p><h2>A PhD Is Not Enough!: A Guide to Survival in Science</h2><p><b>Everything you ever need to know about making it as a scientist.</b><br>Despite your graduate education, brainpower, and technical prowess, your career in scientific research is far from assured.

None of us dreamed that if we achieved that goal, we would stay right on the train till we reached a place where brain-injured children might even be made superior to unhurt children.</p> <p>The trip has thus far taken a half-century. The accommodations were third class and the diner served mostly sandwiches, night after night, often at three in the morning. The tickets cost all we had, and while some of us did not live long enough to finish the trip none of us would have missed it for anything else the world has to offer. It&#x2019;s been a fascinating trip.</p> <p>The original passenger list included a brain surgeon, a physiatrist (an M.D. who specializes in physical medicine and rehabilitation), a physical therapist, a speech therapist, a psychologist, an educator, and a nurse. Now there are more than a hundred of us all told, with many additional kinds of specialists.</p> <p>The little team was formed originally because each of us was individually charged with some phase of the treatment of severely brain-injured children&#x2015;and each of us individually was failing.</p> <p>If you are going to choose a creative field in which to work, it is difficult to pick one with more room for improvement than one in which failure has been one hundred percent and success is nonexistent.</p> <p>When we began our work together over fifty years ago<em> we had never seen, or heard of, a single brain-injured child who had ever gotten well.</em></p> <p><em></em>The group that formed after our individual failures would today be called a rehabilitation team. In those days so long ago, neither of those words were fashionable and we looked upon ourselves as nothing so grand as all that. Perhaps we saw ourselves more practically and more clearly as a group who had banded together, much as a convoy does, hoping that we would be stronger together than we had proved to be separately.</p> <p>We began by attacking the most basic problem that faced those who dealt with brain-injured children fifty years ago. This problem was identification. There were three very different kinds of children with problems who were invariably mixed together as if they were the same. The fact is that they were not even ninety-second cousins. They got lumped together in those days (and, tragically, they still are in much of the world) for the very poor reason that they frequently look, and sometimes act, the same.</p> <p>The three kinds of children who were constantly put together were deficient children with brains that were qualitatively and quantitatively inferior, psychotic children with physically normal brains but unsound minds, and finally truly brain-injured children who had good brains but which had been physically hurt.</p> <p>We were concerned only with the last type of children, who had suffered injuries to a brain that at conception was perfectly good. We came to learn that although the truly deficient child and the truly psychotic child were comparatively few in number, hundreds of thousands of children were, and are, diagnosed as deficient or psychotic, while they were actually brain-injured children. Generally such mistaken diagnoses came about because many of the brain-injured children incurred injuries to a good brain before they were born.</p> <p>When we had learned, after many years of work in the operating room and at the bedside, which children were truly brain-injured, we could then begin to attack the problem itself&#x2015;the injured brain.</p> <p>We discovered that it mattered very little (except from a research point of view) whether a child had incurred his injury prenatally, at the instant of birth, or postnatally. This was rather like being concerned about whether a child had been hit by an automobile before noon, at noon, or after noon. What really mattered was which part of his brain had been hurt, how much it had been hurt, and what might be done about it.</p> <p>We discovered further that it mattered very little whether a child&#x2019;s good brain had been hurt as a result of his parents having an incompatible Rh factor, his mother having had an infectious disease such as German measles during the first three months of pregnancy, insufficient oxygen having reached his brain during the prenatal period, or because he had been born prematurely. The brain can also be hurt as a result of protracted labor, by the child&#x2019;s falling on his head at two months of age and suffering blood clots on his brain, by having a high temperature with encephalitis at three years of age, by being struck by an automobile at five years of age, or by any of a hundred other factors.</p> <p>Again, while this was significant from the research point of view, it was rather like worrying about whether a particular child had been hit by a car or a hammer. The important thing here was which part of the child&#x2019;s brain was hurt, how much it was hurt, and what we were going to do about it.</p> <p>In those early days, the world that dealt with brain-injured children held the view that the problems of these children might be solved by treating the symptoms which existed in the ears, eyes, nose, mouth, chest, shoulders, elbows, wrist, fingers, hips, knees, ankles, and toes. A large portion of the world still believes this today.</p> <p>Such an approach did not work then and could not possibly work.</p> <p>Because of this total lack of success, we concluded that if we were to solve the multiple symptoms of the brain-injured child we would have to attack the source of the problem and approach the human brain itself.</p> <p>While at first this seemed an impossible or at least monumental task, in the years that followed we and others found both surgical and nonsurgical methods of treating the brain itself.</p> <p>We held the simple belief that to treat the symptoms of an illness or injury, and to expect the disease to disappear, was unmedical, unscientific, and irrational, and if all these reasons were not enough to make us abandon such an attack, then the simple fact remained that brain-injured children approached in such a manner never got well.</p> <p>On the contrary, we felt that if we could attack the problem itself, the symptoms would disappear spontaneously to the exact extent of our success in dealing with the injury in the brain itself.</p> <p>First we tackled the problem from a nonsurgical standpoint. In the years that followed, we became persuaded that if we could hope to succeed with the hurt brain itself we would have to find ways to reproduce in some manner the neurological growth patterns of a well child. This meant understanding how a well child&#x2019;s brain begins, grows, and matures. We studied intently many hundreds of well newborn babies, infants, and children. We studied them very carefully.</p> <p>As we learned what normal brain growth is and means, we began to find that the simple and long-known basic activities of well children, such as crawling and creeping, are of the greatest possible importance to the brain. We learned that if such activities are denied well children, because of cultural, environmental, or social factors, their potential is severely limited. The potential of brain-injured children is even more affected.</p> <p>As we learned more about ways to reproduce this normal physical pattern of growing up, we began to see brain-injured children improve&#x2015;ever so slightly.</p> <p>It was at about this time that the neurosurgical components of our team began to prove conclusively that the answer lay in the brain itself, by developing successful surgical approaches to it. There were certain types of brain-injured children whose problems were of a progressive nature, and these children had consistently died early. Chief among these were the hydrocephalics, the children with &#x201c;water on the brain.&#x201d; Such children had huge heads due to the pressure of cerebrospinal fluid that could not be reabsorbed in the normal manner due to their injuries. Nevertheless the fluid continued to be created as in normal people.</p> <p>No one had ever been quite so foolish as to try to treat the symptoms of this disease by massage or exercise or braces. As the pressure on the brain increased these children had always died. Our neurosurgeon, working with an engineer, developed a tube which carried the excess cerebrospinal fluid <em>from</em> the reservoirs called the ventricles, deep inside the human brain, to the jugular vein and thus into the blood stream, where it could be reabsorbed in the normal manner. This tube had within it an ingenious valve that would permit the excess fluid to flow outward while simultaneously preventing the blood from flowing back into the brain.</p> <p>This almost magical device was surgically implanted within the brain and was called &#x201c;the V-J shunt.&#x201d; The lives of more than twenty-five thousand children were saved by this simple tube. Many of these children were able to live completely normal lives and go to school with their peers.</p> <p>This was beautiful evidence of the complete futility of attacking the symptoms of brain injury, as well as the unassailable logic and necessity for treating the hurt brain itself.</p> <p>Another startling method will serve as an example of the many types of successful brain surgery that are in use today to solve the problems of the brain-injured child.</p> <p>There are actually two brains, a right brain and a left brain. These two brains are divided right down the middle of the head from front to rear. In well human beings, the right brain (or, if you like, the right half of the brain) is responsible for controlling the left side of the body, while the left half of the brain is responsible for running the right side of the body.</p> <p>If one half of the brain is hurt to any large degree, the results are catastrophic. The opposite side of the body will be paralyzed, and the child will be severely restricted in all functions. In those days some children had constant, severe, and convulsive seizures which did not respond to any known medication.</p> <p>It need hardly be said that such children also die.</p> <p>The ancient cry of those who stood for doing nothing had been chanted over and over for decades. &#x201c;When a brain cell is dead it is dead and nothing can be done for children with dead brain cells, so don&#x2019;t try.&#x201d; But by 1955 the neurosurgical members of our group were performing an almost unbelievable kind of surgery on such children; it is called hemispherectomy.</p> <p>Hemispherectomy is precisely what that name implies&#x2015;the surgical removal of half of the human brain.</p> <p>At that time we saw children with half a brain in the head and with the other half, billions of brain cells, in ajar at the hospital&#x2015;dead and gone. But the children were not dead.</p> <p>Instead we saw children with only half a brain who walked, talked, and went to school like other children. <em>Several such children were above, average, and at least one of them had an I.Q. in the genius area.</em></p> <p><em></em>We had long held that, contrary to popular belief, a child might have ten dead brain cells and we would not even know it. Perhaps, we said, he might have a hundred dead brain cells, and we would not be aware of it. Perhaps, we said, even a thousand.</p> <p>Not in our wildest dreams had we dared to believe that a child might have <em>billions</em> of dead brain cells and yet perform almost as well and sometimes even better than an average child.</p> <p>Now the reader must join us in a speculation. How long could we look at Johnny, who had half his brain removed, and see him perform as well as Billy, who had an intact brain, without asking the question, &#x201c;What is wrong with Billy?&#x201d; Why did not Billy, who had twice as much brain as Johnny, perform twice as well or at least better?</p> <p>Having seen this happen over and over again, we began to look with new and questioning eyes at average children.</p> <p>Were average children doing as well as they might? Here was an important question we had never dreamed of asking.</p> <p>In the meantime, the nonsurgical members of the team had acquired a great deal more knowledge of how such children grow and how their brains develop. As our knowledge of normality increased, our simple methods for reproducing that normality in brain-injured children kept pace. By now we were beginning to see a small number of brain-injured children reach wellness by the use of the simple nonsurgical methods of treatment which were steadily evolving and improving.</p> <p>It is not the purpose of this book to detail either the concepts or the methods used to solve the multiple problems of brain-injured children. The book <em>What To Do About Your Brain-Injured Child</em> deals with the treatment of the brain-injured child. However, the fact that this is being accomplished daily is of significance in understanding the pathway which led to the knowledge that well children can perform infinitely better than they are doing at present. It is sufficient to say that extremely simple techniques were devised to reproduce, in brain-injured children, the patterns of normal development.</p> <p>Soon we began to see severely brain-injured children whose performance rivaled that of children who had not suffered a brain injury.</p> <p>As these techniques improved even more, we began to see brain-injured children emerge who could not only perform as well as average children but, indeed, who could not be distinguished from them.</p> <p>As our understanding of neurological growth and normality began to assume a really clear pattern, and as methods for the recapitulation of normality multiplied, <em>we even began to see some brain-injured children who performed at above-average, or even superior, levels.</em></p> <p><em></em>It was exciting beyond measure. It was even a little bit frightening. It seemed clear that we had, at the very least, underestimated every child&#x2019;s potential.</p> <p>This raised a fascinating question. Suppose we looked at three seven-year-old children: Albert, who had half his brain in the jar; Billy, who had a perfectly normal brain; and Charley, who had been treated nonsurgically and who now performed in a totally normal way, although he still had millions of brain cells dead and gone.</p> <p>Albert, with half his brain gone, was as intelligent as Billy. So was Charley, with millions of dead cells in his head.</p> <p><em>What was wrong with nice, average, unhurt Billy?</em></p> <p><em></em>What was wrong with <em>well</em> children?</p> <p>For years our work had been charged with the vibrancy that one feels prior to important events and great discoveries. Through the years the all-enveloping <em>fog</em> of mystery which surrounded our brain-injured children had gradually dispelled. We had also begun to see other facts for which we had not bargained. These were facts about well children. A logical connection had emerged between the brain-injured (and t...</p></p><h2>Speakeasy: The Employees Only Guide to Classic Cocktails Reimagined</h2><p>Time-honored cocktails like the New York Sour and the Sidecar were born during the era of Prohibition, the blessedly bygone social experiment that turned drinking into an underground adventure.

In <i>Speakeasy</i>, Kosmas and Zaric take their inspiration from traditional favorites, then use the finest spirits, the freshest ingredients, and a good measure of reverence for their craft to elevate the mixed drink to artisanal status.&nbsp;<br><br>More than 80 imaginative libations that riff on the classics are showcased in this one-of-a-kind collection. Recipes emphasize fresh fruits and herbs, homemade syrups and infusions, and a careful balancing of flavors, with a mind toward seasonality.

His first graphic novel, <i>Journey Into Mohawk Country</i>, used as its sole text the actual historical journal of the seventeenth-century Dutch trader Harmen Meyndertsz van den Bogaert, and told the true story of how New York almost wasn't. He followed that up with <i>Ball Peen Hammer</i>, the first graphic novel written by playwright Adam Rapp, a dark, dystopian view of a society's collapse. Now he has brought his attention to Olympians, an ongoing series retelling the classic Greek myths in comics form. In addition to his graphic novel career, O'Connor has published several children's picture books, including the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling <i>Kapow</i>, <i>Sally and the Some-Thing</i>, and <i>Uncle Bigfoot</i>. He lives in Brooklyn, NY.Starred Review. Grade 5&#x2013;9&#x2014;Five myths featuring the Greek goddess are included in this volume. Dialogue is modern ("What's gotten into you, Zeus?" "I wanna bite him!"), while narration, provided by the Fates, retains a more formal tone. A good balance is struck between exposition and action: readers familiar with these stories will enjoy seeing them brought to life with such vigor, while sufficient background is provided so that children reading about the Greek gods for the first time will not find themselves lost at sea. The family tree of the immortals is a useful tool even for the most experienced readers. O'Connor's drawings, full of energetic diagonals and expressive faces, are nicely balanced by spare settings and minimalistic backgrounds. A sophisticated color palette, full of midtones and subtle contrasts, and panel layouts that vary from page to page further distinguish the art. The author's affection for his subject is evident in a chatty note. Profiles of major characters, notes, and discussion questions appear in addition to the usual back matter.

She had a mischievous way about her that pulled me in. She always smelled of oranges, her fingers sticky from sucking on slices of the fruit as the juices dripped down her chin and hands. She left a trail of orange peels everywhere she went. I was in awe of her pin-straight hair that could do anything she wanted it to but mostly rested on her shoulders, two vertical lines framing her gamine face. Mine was curly and unruly, and my mother insisted on having it fashioned into an unflattering bowl cut. Since I was no longer allowed to go outside or visit friends without my parents chaperoning, much of our playing happened at our house. Sonia never asked why&#x2014;I just let her believe it was because my parents were extremely religious. When we weren&#x2019;t building blanket forts, we spent afternoons on the veranda flashing everyone who walked by, spreading our legs wide open and exposing our vaginas, breaking out into peals of laughter with each look of horror we received.<br> &nbsp;<br> Some days, Sonia wanted to play doctor. She&#x2019;d pull down her pants and ask me to give her an injection, and I&#x2019;d pretend to inject her warm skin with a piece of chalk, its tip pointy and startlingly cold. The chalky imprint of my hand would remain on her bum as she pulled up her pants, laughing. We&#x2019;d often play in the musty, abandoned room on the second floor above our unit that was full of discarded furniture and yards of fabric my mother had purchased to bring to Sonia&#x2019;s mother. One day, when I suggested we tell each other stories instead of playing doctor, she began to tell me a dirty tale of two lovers, Idris and Sahar, who undressed in front of each other&#x2014;but she abruptly ended the story just when my heart started racing with anticipation. I needed to know what happened next.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I have to go,&#x201d; she blurted. &#x201c;Next time!&#x201d; She patted my mop of curls and grabbed her backpack, flashing me an impish smile on her way out the door.<br> &nbsp;<br> For days, I waited for her to come back and finish the story. A week went by. Unable to bear the suspense any longer, I told my parents I was going to visit Sonia, knowing full well I wasn&#x2019;t allowed to venture out unaccompanied. When they prodded, I recounted the whole sordid story. As expected, my parents told Sonia&#x2019;s parents that she wasn&#x2019;t allowed to visit our house ever again.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was nearing four o&#x2019;clock and my mother still had to pick up a cake before the guests arrived and my dad came home from work. She asked Pinky to keep an eye on my sisters and me so that she could run some errands and swing by the bakery. She knew how much I loved the dense, spongy cake soaked in rosewater and layered with thick cream and ripe fruit. As she opened the door, the smell of burning tires infiltrated the hallway. Without giving it much thought, she headed out the door, the smell lingering in the air. After all, the birthday would be incomplete without the cake.<br> &nbsp;<br> The bakery was only ten minutes away, so we were worried when an hour went by and neither my mother nor my father had come home. When my mother finally showed up, she had with her Osman and his mother, along with five other Shia families from the street. Sunni and Shia conflicts had erupted throughout Lahore, and my mother had gathered this band of strangers together and offered temporary refuge from the rioting in the streets. As Ahmadis, we were the only family in the neighbourhood to be spared the wrath of Sunni extremists. For once, the target wasn&#x2019;t us.<br> &nbsp;<br> The cause of the conflict goes back some fourteen hundred years. Immediately following the death of Prophet Muhammad, the two sects clashed over who his successor should be. Shias believe that Ali, the Prophet&#x2019;s cousin and son-in-law, was the rightful successor, whereas Sunnis argue that it was Abu Bakr, the Prophet&#x2019;s trusted advisor. Centuries of bloodshed have followed. Shias claim that Sunnis have received preferential treatment from the Pakistani government since 1948, soon after Pakistan was founded, and that their freedom of speech is consistently threatened. Around the time of my birthday, things had gotten particularly violent after the assassination of Arif Hussain Hussaini, founding leader of Tehrik-e-Jafaria, a religious organization that represented the Shias.<br> &nbsp;<br> Amid all the mayhem, I marvelled at how my mother had managed to find a cake when all the shops were either closed or vandalized. I was even more shocked that she had made it home safe, unaffected by the tear gas or the rioters who were setting fire to everything in sight, the thick fumes permeating our house through the roofless courtyard where everyone had gathered. To a seven-year-old, it seemed the world was coming to an end. If my mother was panicked that my father was still not home, she certainly didn&#x2019;t let it show.<br> &nbsp;<br> I looked at Osman, who had taken refuge under his mother&#x2019;s arm and was pressing his nose against it. There were other children, too&#x2014;some my age or younger, some old enough to require a burka to hide the curves of their bodies. I couldn&#x2019;t help feeling relieved that this time it wasn&#x2019;t us. But the fear I witnessed was intensely familiar. Who belonged if none of us did? I had never felt as close to Shias as I did that day.<br> &nbsp;<br> My mother, perhaps opting for a distraction, removed the wrapping from the cake and placed it on the dining table. Pinky heated a pot of goat&#x2019;s milk for chai and poured it into eight terracotta cups. The smell of cardamom temporarily replaced the pungent odour of burning cars.<br> &nbsp;<br> When the phone rang, my mother almost dropped the tray of pakoras and ran toward it. &#x201c;<i>Kee haal hai?</i>&#x201d;&#x2014;How are you?&#x2014;she asked ironically, knowing my father was probably plotting how to get home safely while police had blocked off access to our street. She spoke in Punjabi, the language my parents used when they didn&#x2019;t want us to know what they were talking about, not realizing we&#x2019;d picked it up over the years.<br> &nbsp;<br> We were startled by a flurry of loud knocks on the front door and the voices on the other side demanding that we open it. We all knew that the men outside were after the Shias hiding in our house. My mother hung up the phone and, with the help of the other women, pushed a heavy cupboard full of china and ceramics in front of the door. As the thumping persisted, she silently lit the candles on the cake, one for each of my seven years. Taking our cue from her calm demeanour, we all gathered around the table as if nothing out of the ordinary was happening. After a loud chorus of &#x201c;Happy Birthday&#x201d; drowned out the noise in the background, I blew out the candles. My mother carefully plated each dish with an equal slice of cake, pakoras, and chaat and handed them to everyone in our house.<br> &nbsp;<br> Soon it was time for Maghrib prayer. Pinky and the other women lined the concrete floor with bedsheets, and we Ahmadis prayed with our Shia neighbours for the first time, our bodies so close there was barely space between us. My eyes wandered to the different placement of hands on the chests of our Shia guests, placed higher than I was accustomed to. It struck me that despite our differences, we were all terrified of the same people.<br> &nbsp;<br> The knocks eventually stopped and we wondered if the riots had too. Then we heard a heavy thud on the roof. We all lifted our heads in panic, and mothers tightly clutched their children. Then my dad emerged from the top floor, climbing down the stairs to the courtyard. Eager to unite with us, he had scaled the wall of a house at the end of our street and jumped between the rooftops until he reached ours. I had never in my life been happier to see him.</p><h2>The Pigeon Tunnel: Stories from My Life</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Recounted with the storytelling �lan of a master raconteur &#x2014; by turns dramatic and funny, charming, tart and melancholy.&#x201d;&nbsp;</b>&#x2013;<b>Michiko Kakutani,&nbsp;<i>The New York Times<br></i></b><br><b>The&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestselling memoir from John le Carr�, the legendary author of&nbsp;<i>A Legacy of Spies.</i>&nbsp;John le Carr�&#x2019;s&nbsp;new novel,&nbsp;<i>Agent Running in the Field</i>, is coming October 2019.</b><br><br>From his years serving in British Intelligence during the Cold War, to a career as a writer that took him from war-torn Cambodia to Beirut on the cusp of the 1982 Israeli invasion to Russia before and after the collapse of the Berlin Wall, le Carr�&nbsp;has always written from the heart of modern times.&nbsp;In this, his first memoir,&nbsp;le Carr� is as funny as he is incisive, reading into the events he witnesses the same moral ambiguity with which he imbues his novels.

She lives in New York City.</p>reSchool-Grade 2-Richards's carefully worded information provides an excellent introduction to seeds, their purpose, and growth that should be easy for young children to grasp. On each page, one or two short lines of text appear beneath a large painting. Hariton's use of bright watercolors adds sensual appeal to her illustrations of various fruits, vegetables, animals, and habitats. This cleverly presented book can be used as a read-aloud discussion starter, as a prelude to planting seeds and observing their growth, or in preparation for dissecting fruits and vegetables in order to find the seeds inside. Two final pages in question-and-answer format offer more tidbits of information about seeds. Tiny silhouette people and suitcases parading across the bottom of the pages visually emphasize the suitcase theme in a manner that is appropriate for the intended audience. Allan Fowler's From Seed to Plant (Children's, 2001) presents similar material and is accompanied by color photos and diagrams. Helene J. Jordan's How a Seed Grows (HarperCollins, 1992) and Gail Gibbons's From Seed to Plant (Holiday, 1991), both of them a bit more sophisticated, contain additional information on how seeds grow into plants and would make great companions to Richards's book.<br><i>Susan Scheps, Shaker Heights Public Library, OH</i><br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Warriors: Enter the Clans (Warriors Field Guide)</h2><p><p><strong>Discover the secrets of Erin Hunter&#x2019;s #1 bestselling Warriors series.

She's not about to walk, she'd rather ride her horse. And Pippi can't be bothered with spelling and math; she's more interested in drawing on the floor and finding out when Christmas vacation starts. Pippi may be ready for school, but is school ready for Pippi? <br><br><i>Pippi Goes to School</i> is a great introduction for young children to the wacky, wonderful world of Pippi Longstocking.</p><p>Pippi Longstocking's long red braids are the very image of childhood rebellion. In <i>Pippi Goes to School</i>, our heroine's insurrectionary spirit is hardly dampened by her first taste of academe. Her friends Tommy and Annika head off bright and early at 8 a.m., "hand in hand, swinging their schoolbags." Pippi can't be bothered to get going until a little later: "At exactly ten o'clock she lifted her horse off the front porch, and a little later all the people in the town ran to their windows to see what horse it was that was running away." It's just Pippi headed for school in her own inimitable fashion. The teacher's vain attempts to teach her math and art and music fail miserably. When asked to add 7 and 5, she retorts, "If you don't know that yourself, you needn't think I'm going to tell you." It's not that Pippi's naughty, it's just that she has her own way of doing things. At the end of the day, it's she who's consoling the exhausted teacher: "You understand, Teacher, don't you, that when you have a mother who's an angel and father who's a cannibal king, and when you have sailed on the ocean all your whole life, then you don't know just how to behave in school." This slender paperback picture book is neatly adapted from the Astrid Lindgren classic <i>Pippi Longstocking</i>, with assistance from Lindgren herself. Michael Chesworth's lively, modernized illustrations make clever reference to the original edition, without being slavish. (Ages 4 to 8)--<i>Claire Dederer</i><b>Astrid Lindgren</b> (1907&#x2013;2002) was born in Sweden. After college, she worked in a newspaper office and a Swedish publishing house. Her most famous and beloved book,&nbsp;<i>Pippi Longstocking</i>, was originally published in Swedish in 1950 and was later translated into many other languages. It was followed by two sequels, <i>Pippi Goes on Board&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Pippi in the South Seas</i>. Ms. Lindgren had a long, prolific career, writing more than 100 picture books, poems, short stories, plays, screenplays, and novels. In 1958, she won the Hans Christian Andersen Medal, the highest international award in children&#x2019;s literature.</p><h2>Nearing Home: Life, Faith, and Finishing Well</h2><p><p><strong><em>New York Times</em></strong><strong>&nbsp;best-seller and 2012 ECPA Book of the Year.</strong><strong>*</strong></p><p><strong>Join Billy Graham as he shares the challenges of fading strength but still&nbsp;standing strong in his commitment to finishing life well.</strong></p><p>Growing old has been the greatest surprise of my life,&#x201d; said Billy Graham,&nbsp;known by many as God&#x2019;s Ambassador. &#x201c;I would have never guessed what&nbsp;God had in store for me, and I know that as I am nearing home, He will not&nbsp;forsake me the last mile of the way.&#x201d;</p><p><em>Nearing Home</em>, written by Billy Graham in his nineties, explores the&nbsp;challenges of aging while gleaning foundational truths from Scripture.

In its branches and on its trunk are ants, a spider on a web, a downy woodpecker, an owl, squirrels, baby robins in a nest, a moth's cocoon&#x2014;even children on a swing&#x2014;while chipmunks and a tiny mole live and eat beneath. The large oak describes its roots ("winding and long;/they anchor and feed me and help me grow strong"), leaves ("...breathing out air for all to breathe in"), and boughs ("...that creak, bend, and sway/shading the children below as they play"). Handsome realistic oil paintings set on white pages show details of the tree and its denizens in daytime, at sunset, and at night, in fall and in summer. Observant eyes will notice grubs burrowed underground, new leaf buds, and a tiny ladybug nestled on a leaf. The cycle of new life and growth is demonstrated as the youngsters collect and plant an acorn that grows into another large tree "as seasons pass by." Children will enjoy this brief glimpse at a familiar species that reinforces much that they have already observed.&#x2014;<i>Susan Scheps, Shaker Heights Public Library, OH</i> END</p><h2>The Gospel according to God: Rediscovering the Most Remarkable Chapter in the Old Testament</h2><p><p><strong>Winner of the ECPA Book of the Year Award for&nbsp;Bible Study</strong></p><p><em>&#x201c;He was pierced for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his wounds we are healed.&#x201d; (Isaiah 53:5)</em></p><p>Often hailed as one of the greatest chapters in the Bible, the prophecy of the suffering servant in Isaiah 53 foretells the crucifixion of Jesus, the central event in God&#x2019;s ultimate plan to redeem the world.</p><p>This book explains the prophetic words of Isaiah 53 verse by verse, highlighting important connections to the history of Israel and to the New Testament&#x2015;ultimately showing us how this ancient prophecy illuminates essential truths that undergird our lives today.</p></p><p><p><strong>John MacArthur</strong>&nbsp;is the&nbsp;pastor-teacher of Grace Community Church in Sun Valley, California, where he has served since 1969.

Richards Professor of Systematic and Historical Theology, Reformed Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;Isaiah 52:13&#x2013;53:12 shows the height, depth, and width of the wisdom of God and even the infallibility of his Word. And all that richness is made clear in this book by one of the most gifted and Bible-saturated teachers of our times. MacArthur has done it again; this is the result of searching, believing, and exposing the Scriptures for almost half a century. As you read this profound study, our Redeemer looks more gracious, merciful, desirable, and worthy. This is a must-read!&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Miguel N��ez,</strong> Senior Pastor, International Baptist Church, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic; Founding President, Wisdom &amp; Integrity Ministries</p><p>&#x201c;As an eight-year-old boy in a Scottish state school I was &#x2018;forced&#x2019; to learn Isaiah 53 by heart. The teacher said it was about Jesus. She was right. But I wish she had been able to read <i>The Gospel according to God</i>. Then she could have shown me how Isaiah&#x2019;s prophecy would be fulfilled in detail. And she could have helped me to understand the meaning of the terrible loneliness, violence, shame, and rejection the Savior endured for me. That&#x2019;s what <i>The Gospel according to God</i> does. And it does it with all the Bible-saturated boldness we have come to expect from its author, John MacArthur.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Sinclair B. Ferguson,</strong> Chancellor&#x2019;s Professor of Systematic Theology, Reformed Theological Seminary; Teaching Fellow, Ligonier Ministries</p><p>&#x201c;We have all gained immensely from the pen and preaching of John MacArthur for almost half a century due to his unflinching fidelity to the Scriptures. In <i>The Gospel according to God</i> he is again in his element as he deals with a matter at the very heart of the Christian gospel&#x2015;Christ&#x2019;s atoning sacrifice. Isaiah 53 is a rare but amazingly rich vein of gospel truth, and Dr. MacArthur mines it with his usual precision and evangelical warmth. If you want to gain a fresh view of Calvary&#x2019;s love to enlarge your mind and heart, this is the book to buy and read!&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Conrad Mbewe,</strong> Pastor, Kabwata Baptist Church; Chancellor, African Christian University, Lusaka, Zambia</p></p><h2>If You Were a Kid in the Thirteen Colonies (If You Were a Kid)</h2><p><b>Get a first hand look into the early days the North American Colonies.</b><br><br>It is winter of 1724 in the North American colonies.

Shore was among the first artists to take color beyond the domain of advertising and fashion photography, and his large-format color work on the American vernacular landscape inaugurated a vital photographic tradition. "Uncommon Places: The Complete Works," published by Aperture in 2005, presented a definitive collection of the landmark series, and in the span of a decade has become a contemporary classic. Now, for this lushly produced reissue, the artist has added nearly 20 rediscovered images and a statement explaining what it means to expand a classic series. Like Robert Frank and Walker Evans before him, Shore discovered a hitherto unarticulated vision of America via highway and camera. Approaching his subjects with cool objectivity, Shore retains precise systems of gestures in composition and light through which a hotel bedroom or a building on a side street assumes both an archetypal aura and an ambiguously personal importance. An essay by critic and curator Stephan Schmidt-Wulffen and a conversation with Shore by writer Lynne Tillman examine his methodology and elucidate his roots in Pop and Conceptual art. The texts are illustrated with reproductions from Shore's earlier series "American Surfaces" and "Amarillo: Tall in Texas."<br>At age 14 Stephen Shore (born 1947) had his work purchased by Edward Steichen for The Museum of Modern Art, New York. At 17 Shore was a regular at Andy Warhol's Factory, producing an important photographic document of the scene, and in 1971 at the age of 23 he became the first living photographer since Alfred Stieglitz 40 years earlier to have a one-man show at the Met. He has had numerous one-man shows, among others at The Museum of Modern Art, New York; George Eastman House, Rochester; Hammer Museum, Los Angeles; and The Art Institute of Chicago. Since 1982 he has been Director of the Photography Program at Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, New York.</p><p>At age fourteen, Stephen Shore had his work purchased by Edward Steichen for the Museum of Modern Art, New York.

Tillman's new novel, American Genius, A Comedy, will be published in October by Soft Skull Press.On any list of must-own photo books, Stephen Shore's 1982 classic, Uncommon Places, deserves pride of place. Shore, now 67, helped spearhead the use of color (once the exclusive province of advertising and fashion) in fine-art photography while documenting the American landscape, transforming the banal (diners, back alleys, ticky-tacky suburbs) into extraordinary tableau. Now the book is being reissued with 20 previously unseen images, as Uncommon Places: The Complete Works, giving you a eason to search for a collectible first edition on Amazon.

They are reassured when he nobly saves the day in imaginary-play sessions as a cowboy or cop and his mustache looks good-guy great. But as time passes, their worst fears are confirmed when little Billy&#x2019;s mustache starts to curl up at the ends in a suspiciously villainous fashion. Sure enough, &#x201c;Billy&#x2019;s disreputable mustache led him into a life of dreadful crime.&#x201d; Plenty of tongue-in-cheek humor and cartoonish illustrations make this the perfect baby-shower gift for a mustachioed father-to-be.</p><p>Bridget Heos is the author of more than 60 children&#39;s books, including Mustache Baby, Stronger than Steel (a Scientists in the Field book), and many nonfiction titles.

Visit her at authorbridgetheos.com or on Facebook @Author Bridget Heos.It&#x2019;s apparent right from the start: Baby Billy has been born with a mustache. When asked what it means, the nurse replies that it depends on &#x201c;whether it&#x2019;s a good-guy mustache or a bad-guy mustache.&#x201d; At first, it&#x2019;s good. He becomes a toddler lawman, catching thieves with their hands in the cookie jar. But as his mustache grows and curls up at the ends, Billy becomes bad. Very bad. Throughout, the text relies on puns that the intended audience may not catch as Billy becomes a cat burglar and then a cereal criminal. What children will delight in, however, is Ang&#x2019;s sturdy digital artwork, which gives her characters the heft of wooden toys even as they zip around the page. The pictures wring every bit of fun and humor from the story, with Billy taking on many mustachioed personas including painter, pilot, and cowboy (good) as well as train robber (bad). The intriguingly designed book shows Billy from many angles, often on the move, sometimes behind (crib) bars, and full of personality. The surprise ending accents the fun. A mustached baby will surely make audiences howl during read-alouds.

Gordon Liddy</b></p><p>A thoroughly revised and updated edition of the essential guide to preserving your personal security </p><p>From cyberspace to crawl spaces, new innovations in information gathering have left the private life of the average person open to scrutiny, and worse, exploitation. In this thoroughly updated third edition of his immensely popular guide How to Be Invisible, J.J. Luna shows you how to protect your home address, hide your ownership of vehicles and real estate, use pagers with dumbphones, switch to low-profile banking and invisible money transfers, use alternate signatures, and how to secretly run a home-based business.</p><p>J.J. Luna is an expert and highly trained security consultant with years of experience protecting himself, his family, and his clients. Using real life stories and his own consulting experience, J.J. Luna divulges legal methods to attain the privacy you crave and deserve, whether you want to shield yourself from casual scrutiny or take your life savings with you and disappear without a trace. Whatever your needs, Luna reveals the shocking secrets that private detectives and other seekers of personal information use to uncover information and then shows how to make a serious commitment to safeguarding yourself.</p><p>There is a prevailing sense in our society that true privacy is a thing of the past. In a world where privacy concerns that only continue to grow in magnitude, How to Be Invisible, Third Edition is a critical antidote to the spread of new and more efficient ways of undermining our personal security. </p><p>Privacy is a commonly-lamented casualty of the Information Age and of the world's changing climate--but that doesn't mean you have to stand for it. This new edition of J. J. Luna's classic manual contains step-by-step advice on building and maintaining your personal security, including brand new chapters on:</p><p>- The dangers from Facebook, smartphones, and facial recognition<br>- How to locate a nominee (or proxy) you can trust-<br>- The art of pretexting, aka social engineering<br>- Moving to Baja California Sur; San Miguel de Allende, Guanajuato; Cuenca, Ecuador; or Spain's Canary Islands<br>- The secrets of international privacy, and much more!</p></p><p><p>In 1959, J. J. (Jack) Luna sold his outdoor advertising business in the Upper Midwest and moved with his wife and small children to Spain's Canary Islands. Outwardly, he was a professional writer and photographer. Secretly, he worked underground in an activity that was at that time illegal under the regime of Generalissimo Francisco Franco. Although many of his friends were jailed or deported, Luna was never apprehended.</p><p>In 1970 Franco moderated Spain's laws, leaving Luna free to come in from the cold. By that time, however, privacy and secrecy had become ingrained habits. In the years that followed he started up various low-profile one-person businesses, built them up, and then sold them. Since 1999 he's worked&#x2015;among other things&#x2015;as an international consultant specializing in personal privacy and security.</p>1 <br> <br>HOW THIS BOOK CAN MAKE YOU INVISIBLE <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>One day you can be on the top of the world; the next day you can be in hell. One of Wiley Miller&#x2019;s <i>Non Sequitur</i> cartoon strips is titled &#x201c;LEGAL MUGGING.&#x201d; It shows a businessman on the sidewalk of a dark street with his hands in the air. A sign on a post reads: <br>CAUTION: <br>WATCH FOR TRIAL ATTORNEYS. <br>Stepping from a narrow alley is a lawyer wearing a stocking cap, dark glasses, and holding out a legal document. <br>&#x201c;This is a frivolous lawsuit,&#x201d; says the attorney to his victim. &#x201c;You can either spend years and thousands of dollars defending yourself, or we can settle out of court right now.&#x201d; <br>Although this was in a comic strip, what it portrays is not comical&#x2014;especially when you are served without a hint of advance warning. More than 1 million lawsuits are filed each year in this country. How many of those do you think are frivolous, but are nevertheless settled out of court? <br>More than one reader has answered a knock on the door and went into shock at being greeted by reporters, photographers, and trucks with big satellite dishes outside of his or her home! From this day forward, when you read your newspaper or watch the news on TV, start searching for cases where an unknown person is suddenly thrust into the national spotlight, then ask yourself: <br>COULD THIS POSSIBLY HAPPEN TO ME? <br>The following are just a few of the many things that could bring the media, or worse, to your home: <br>&#x2022; A bomb goes off, you were in the area, and the FBI thinks you fit the profile. <br>&#x2022; An identity sketch of the person who robbed the convenience store at 11:45 p.m. last night is flashed on TV, and it looks just like you. And you don&#x2019;t have a plausible excuse for that time that anyone&#x2019;s going to believe. <br>&#x2022; You were innocently involved with the wrong people and the <i>60 Minutes</i> crew is within minutes of tracking you down. <br>&#x2022; Someone faked your e-mail address when searching for sex with twelve-year-olds, and the police are at your door. <br>An article in <i>Newsweek,</i> titled &#x201c;Getting the Wrong Man,&#x201d; gives a chilling example of something that occurs more often than you might think. <br>Tom Kennedy found the body of his wife, Irene, who had been strangled and stabbed 29 times while on her daily stroll through a park in the Boston suburb of Walpole. Then, a few hours later, the police called at a nearby dilapidated bungalow where Eddie Burke, a 48-year-old handyman, lived with his mother&nbsp;&#x2026; He was practically a textbook match for police profilers: a loner who knew the victim and was clearly eccentric. <br>What on earth does &#x201c;eccentric&#x201d; mean? My best friends&#x2014;with a smile&#x2014;call <i>me</i> eccentric. Do I therefore fit a certain profile? <br>Burke was visibly nervous and gave contradictory answers when questioned by investigators. <br>Wouldn&#x2019;t you be nervous, too? <br>There was blood on his clothes and hands. And forensic dentists would soon match his teeth with bite marks left on Mrs. Kennedy&#x2019;s breast. <br>Burke was arrested for murder. Within twenty-four hours, the police learned that the DNA from the saliva on Mrs. Kennedy&#x2019;s chest could not have come from Burke. Did they then release him? <br>Incredulously, they ran more tests, which again exonerated him. In addition, blood found on Burke turned out to be feline; he had been tending to injured cats. A palm print left on Mrs. Kennedy&#x2019;s thigh didn&#x2019;t match Burke&#x2019;s hand, while the bite-mark evidence proved inconclusive&nbsp;&#x2026; Yet for six weeks, police kept insisting they had the right man in jail&nbsp;&#x2026; While he was locked away, Burke&#x2019;s life was put under a microscope. He was demonized in newspapers and on TV, each story accompanied by a menacing courtroom image of Burke. The sociopathic profiles were fueled by details of his home&#x2019;s contents&#x2014;X-rated videotapes, kitchen knives, the book <i>Men Who Hate Women and the Women Who Love Them.</i> &#x201c;They didn&#x2019;t mention the three Bibles in my room,&#x201d; Burke says. &#x201c;They could just as easily said I was a religious fanatic.&#x201d; <br>The police claim they followed a logical course and &#x201c;had the backing of reputed scientific experts.&#x201d; Let us assume that is correct. The point is that even though Burke was the wrong man, <i>the contents of his house were published by the media.</i> <br>Suppose <i>you</i> are suddenly arrested, even though innocent of the accused crime, and the contents of your home or personal information are made public? Would anything on the following list&#x2014;if found in your house&#x2014;give you cause for concern? <br>&#x2022; Excess cash? <br>&#x2022; Guns and ammunition? <br>&#x2022; The contents of your smartphone? <br>&#x2022; All the e-mails you&#x2019;ve ever sent or received? <br>&#x2022; Empty whiskey bottles or evidence of substance abuse? <br>&#x2022; Statements from your bank, your broker, your credit card company? <br>&#x2022; The contents on your computer&#x2019;s hard drive, including so-called deleted files, along with a list of every search you&#x2019;ve ever made on Google? <br>If the police are after you, whether you are guilty or not, what is your first priority? Is it not <i>time</i>? <br>You need <i>time</i> to think, <i>time</i> to get certain items out of the house, <i>time</i> to locate your attorney, or&#x2014;heaven forbid&#x2014; <i>time</i> to pick up some cash, arrange transportation, and flee. This book is designed to give you that time, and to help you keep your private information <i>private</i>. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Before we continue, let me say that if someone with <i>unlimited funds</i> is after you, you will eventually be found. If you doubt this, contact a competent private investigator and say, &#x201c;I wish to disappear so completely that even <i>you</i> couldn&#x2019;t find me. Can you help me?&#x201d; The six-word answer will be, &#x201c;No, because I can find anyone!&#x201d; <br>And I agree. Repeatedly, private investigators (PIs) make this point in their books, articles, and personal interviews. And if the police are truly after you, <i>their</i> record isn&#x2019;t bad, either. Captain Robert L. Snow, a police officer for more than twenty-five years, says in his book <i>Protecting Your Life, Home, and Property</i> that the Indianapolis Police Department finds 98 or 99 percent of all persons reported to them as missing. <br>In the Private Investigator section of my home library, I find no PIs anywhere who will admit defeat under any circumstances, <i>as long as payment is forthcoming</i>. The closest I can come to a failure is a certain PI who says he successfully tracked down 298 of the 299 targets he was given over his lifetime. As for the one he missed, he eventually concluded that he was given false information, and that no such person ever existed. <br>The fuel that runs a private investigator&#x2019;s engine is M-O-N-E-Y. In your present situation, a PI may come up with your home address with a single phone call, and with a list of your assets the next day. Where this book can help you, then, is to: <br>1. Plug the immediate loopholes in your security. <br>2. Put you on guard, before you ever again give out your Social Security number, home address, or correct date of birth, to anyone other than a government agency. <br>3. Make it so expensive to trace you and/or your assets that the bad guys or gals will give up before achieving their goals. <br>THE FOUR LEVELS OF PRIVACY <br>The direct correlation between money and results cannot be overemphasized. In the sections to come, I&#x2019;ll be referring to various levels of security, with a general outline as follows. However, there may be no clear-cut divisions between one level and the next&#x2014;it depends on who is after you, why, and the price he or she is willing to pay. <br>LEVEL ONE <br>Very basic, economical moves that will give you more privacy than 98 percent of the general population. The opposition might have to pay a private investigator several hundred dollars to track you down. <br>LEVEL TWO <br>At this point your utilities, your smartphones, and your other electronic devices will be in alternate names. The license plates on your vehicles will not reveal your true name and address. Anything confidential will be shredded. The PI may now require $5,000 or more in order to track you down. <br>LEVEL THREE <br>This will almost certainly require a move from your present location. Both your home (or rental property) and your vehicles will be in the names of anonymous limited liability companies (LLCs). Your home address will now be hidden from all but your closest relatives and friends. It will no longer appear on your annual tax returns, <i>or anywhere else</i>. If you follow the directions in chapter 12, &#x201c;E-mail and the Internet,&#x201d; your Internet/e-mail connections will be under cover and the black-hat boys and/or the law firms may have to pay a PI some truly serious money to track you down. Are you worth that much to them? If not, sleep well. <br>LEVEL FOUR <br>At this level you are duplicating the federal Witness Security Program (incorrectly called the Witness &#x201c;Protection&#x201d; Program in the media) for criminals protected by the U.S. government. When the Feds do it for a felon, it&#x2019;s legal. When you do it for yourself, it&#x2019;s illegal. <br>All bridges will now be ashes, friends and relatives just a distant memory. You&#x2019;ve cut all ties with clubs, hobbies, and church, no longer file tax returns, and will never again work for an employer. You may feel this is necessary if there&#x2019;s a bounty on your head or a contract on your life, but at this point, is life still worth living? <br>If so, keep running, because you can <i>still</i> be found. The PI, however, must now have <i>unlimited</i> funds at his disposal, and will call for help. Just as pinned-down soldiers on a battlefield can call in air strikes, PIs can call in investigative reporters. These are the men who dig up celebrity skeletons for tabloids such as the <i>National Enquirer, Globe,</i> and&#x2014;until Rupert Murdoch had to shut it down&#x2014;the tabloid newspaper <i>The Sun</i>. Never underestimate an investigative reporter. These guys may sometimes go to jail&#x2014;as in the Murdoch scandal&#x2014;but until they do, they are the best in the business. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>I recommend you start working on Level One even before you finish reading this book. In the weeks and months to come, raise yourself to Level Two&#x2014;the choice of the majority of my readers. <br>After that, decide whether or not you wish to ease up to Level Three. It may look difficult at first, but countless others have done it and so can you. Not only may it be easier than you think, but it can be fun as well, and lead you to a more stress-free life. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Now let&#x2019;s talk about four more levels: <br>THE FOUR LEVELS OF PURSUIT <br>The first three levels will normally be a private investigator hired by a law firm, a disgruntled stockholder, an ex-lover, an ex-employee, a stalker, a creditor, or any weirdo out for what he or she considers revenge. <br>LEVEL ONE <br>The average small-city one-person PI. He (they are still usually male, though that is slowly changing) sits at his desk and runs whatever data he&#x2019;s been given, using paid national and international databases, common Internet searches, and social media site searches. He may make phone calls to family and friends or church members if the client has provided that contact information. A PI in Tennessee once outlined his standard method of searching for assets: <br>The first thing I do when I search for hidden assets is pull the subject&#x2019;s credit report. I look for credit cards, ATMs, etc., issued by banks. Some small banks like the ones you describe automatically issue these cards. You&#x2019;d have to specifically tell them you don&#x2019;t want them, otherwise they appear on your credit report and the bank is exposed. <br>If he doesn&#x2019;t find you with that method, or in the phone book, he&#x2019;ll usually give up. This type of PI is not normally ready to break any laws, and often makes less than $50,000 a year. <br>LEVEL TWO <br>Sometimes works in gray areas. Is less risk-averse. Is more tenacious and better at networking with subcontractors and contacts inside anything from DMVs and cable companies to cell phone providers and sometimes even police departments. If you have property, vehicles, phones, cable TV, electricity, disposal service, professional or business licenses, or anything else in your name, run for cover! <br>They&#x2019;ll find your employer, family and friends, religious and political affiliations, former school mates and professors. They&#x2019;ll find and search through your financial records in any country. If the legal circumstances exist, they can obtain your school transcripts, or conduct surveillance using sophisticated equipment. They earn mid-to-high-five-figure incomes along the coasts. <br>LEVEL THREE <br>Will subcontract the <i>legal</i> portions of an investigation to the Level Two PIs or to info-brokers. Will bend or break any law if the price is right (think Anthony Pellicano and Chris Butler). They will run credit reports, grab school transcripts and medical information, or search financial records without permission or permissible purpose. <br>They&#x2019;ll bribe police, plant evidence, hire crooks for surreptitious entries and muggers who will take you down to check your wallet for ID, run brothels for information on their clients, and even hire lowlifes who will hold your feet to the fire to get the information they&#x2019;ve been paid to collect. (Former government agents-turned-corporate espionage agents run in these circles.) Makes a high six-to-seven-figure income until caught. <br>LEVEL FOUR <br>Government agents from whatever nation. Sovereignty means nothing to these people (think Osama bin Laden). At this level, give up, jump off a high bridge, or go the route outlined in chapter 24. No life insurance company will insure you. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Sometimes, however, your worst enemy will turn out to be&nbsp;&#x2026; YOU. That&#x2019;s why the next subtitle is: <br>&#x201c;WHOM SHALL I CONFIDE IN?&#x201d; <br>A short, balding man named Stanley Mark Rifkin worked at the Security Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles. Security Pacific thought of him as a computer programmer, but Rifkin thought of himself as a consummate thief. <br>On October 25, he entered the bank, crossed the lobby, and took the elevator up to the wire transfer room. From this room, hundreds of millions of dollars passed every day from Security Pacific through the Federal Reserve system and on to international banks. Rifkin, who identified himself as the bank&#x2019;s computer consultant, was not challenged as he walked into the heavily guarded room. By interviewing one of the workers, he learned the routing instructions, transfer routines, and the day&#x2019;s security code. Before he left, he memorized an employee access code from an information board on the wall. Later that day, posing as a branch manager, he called the wire room. <br>&#x201c;This is Mike Hansen on International.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Okay, and the office number?&#x201d; a friendly female voice asked. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s 286.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And the code?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Code is 4739.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; <br>Now came the moment Rifkin had been living for. <br>&#x201c;The bank,&#x201d; he said, speaking in a calm voice, &#x201c;is Irving Trust in New York City. Payment is to Wozchod Bank, Zurich, Switzerland. The amount is ten million two hundred thousand even.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Okay, and what&#x2019;s the interoffice settlement number?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Let me check. I&#x2019;ll call you right back.&#x201d; He then phoned a different number at the bank. Pretending to be someone working in the wire room, he asked for the settlement number. They gave it to him, and he called the wire room back. The clerk typed his order into the system. Rifkin had just pulled off one of the largest bank thefts in history. Before the day was out, he was high above the Atlan...</p><h2>All That Is Bitter and Sweet: A Memoir</h2><p><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER � In this unforgettable memoir, Ashley Judd describes her odyssey,&nbsp;as a lost child attains international prominence as a fiercely dedicated advocate.</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> In 2002, award-winning film and stage actor Ashley Judd found her true calling: as a humanitarian and voice for those suffering in neglected parts of the world. After her first trip to the notorious brothels, slums, and hospices of southeast Asia, Ashley knew immediately that she wanted to advocate on behalf of the vulnerable. During her travels, Ashley started to write diaries that detailed extraordinary stories of survival and resilience. <br> &nbsp;<br> But along the way, she realized that she was struggling with her own emotional pain, stemming from childhood abandonment and abuse. Seeking in-patient treatment in 2006 for the grief that had nearly killed her, Ashley found not only her own recovery and an enriched faith but the spiritual tools that energized and advanced her feminist social justice work.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her story ranges from anger to forgiveness, isolation to interdependence, depression to activism. In telling it, she resoundingly answers the ineffable question about the relationship between healing oneself and service to others.<br><br><b>Praise for&nbsp;<i>All That Is Bitter and Sweet</i><br></b><br>&#x201c;Ashley Judd has given us magnetic and searingly honest portrayals of diverse women on screen.

So it hasbeen with me as I have undertaken to make sense of my own past.<br><br> Although the home of my heart is in the AppalachianMountains, I always considered it auspicious that I was born in Southern California,one of the most transitory places in the world, during one of the mostturbulent springs in American history. When I arrived by cesarean section atGranada Hills Hospital on April 19, 1968, California was the epicenter of asociety in the throes of a cultural and spiritual upheaval. The Vietnam War wasraging. The nation was still reeling from the assassination of Martin LutherKing Jr., and Bobby Kennedy would soon be gunned down at the Ambassador Hotelin Los Angeles, leaving a generation of idealists lost in a tide of grief andregret. Some of the flower children who had flocked to San Francisco for theSummer of Love were now panhandling for loose change along Hollywood's Sunset Strip-aplace I would soon know well.<br><br> My parents, Michael and Diana Ciminella, were small-town kids from rural eastern Kentucky. Like mosteveryone else in the Los Angeles basin, they had moved to California lookingfor a fresh start in what Joan Didion described as "the golden land whereevery day the world is born anew." In 1967, my parents bought a tracthouse on a cul-de-sac in Sylmar, a suburb carved out of olive groves in the SanFernando Valley, about twenty miles north and a world away from Hollywood. Mydad sold electronic components for the aerospace industry; my mom stayed homeand seethed with boredom. They had dreams, just different ones. And they hadsecrets.<br><br> They had married too young and for the "wrong" reason-namely,the unplanned pregnancy that produced my older sister, Christina (you know heras Wynonna), when Mom was only seventeen. It was a typical story of the time:high school girl becomes pregnant and "has" to marry her teenageboyfriend. But there was a twist: Michael wasn't the father of Diana's baby-somethinghe didn't know at the time of the wedding, and something my sister and I wouldn'tlearn for decades. When I came into the world four years later, my family'stroubled and remarkable course had already been set in motion, powerfullyshaped by my mother's desperate teenage lie and the incredible energy she dedicatedto protecting it.<br><br> I began to understand the dynamics of my past, and how weare only as sick as our secrets, when I was thirty-seven years old and startedon a simple and practical path of personal recovery. It was then that Idiscovered we all belong to two families: our family of choice and our familyof origin. My family of choice is a colorful assortment of surrogate grandparents,aunts, uncles, and friends who infuse me with love, belonging, and acceptance.My family of origin, the one into which I was born, was also brimming with lovebut was not a healthy family system. There was too much trauma, abandonment,addiction, and shame. My mother, while she was transforming herself into thecountry legend Naomi Judd, created an origin myth for the Judds that did notmatch my reality. She and my sister have been quoted as saying that our familyput the "fun" in dysfunction. I wondered: Who, exactly, was havingall the fun? What was I missing?<br><br> As I write these words, I am happy to say that each of ushas embarked on a personal process of healing, and my family is healthier thanit has ever been. We have come far. In our individual and collectiverecoveries, we have learned that mental illness and addiction are familydiseases, spanning and affecting generations. There are robust strains of eachon both sides of my family-manifested in just about everything from depression,suicide, alcoholism, and compulsive gambling to incest and suspected murder-andthese conditions have shaped my parents' stories (even if some of the eventsdid not happen directly to them) as well as my sister's and my own.Fortunately, along with the dysfunction is a legacy of love, resiliency,creativity, and faith in a family whose roots I can trace back at least eightgenerations in the mountains of Kentucky and about 350 years in America, and asfar as the shores of Sicily. That history is as much a part of my DNA as thearch of my eyebrows or the color of my hair. It's imprinted in the soft r's andlong vowels that well up in my voice when I'm speaking about my home place orthe way I whoop for my dogs from the doorway, barefoot, in a nightgown,assuming my mountain woman stance with a hand on one hip, a way of being asnatural to me as breathing.<br><br> Although I now make my home in rural middle Tennessee,eastern Kentucky still calls to me. Kentuckians have a deeply ingrained, almostmystical sense of place-a sense of belonging that defines us. As a teenager, Itook a friend to see my great-aunt Pauline's farm. She passed away when I wasin the fourth grade. Nevertheless, although I had not been there since I wasten years old, I navigated my car deep into the countryside, to her homesteadon Little Cat Creek, without making a single wrong turn. More recently, afterflying over catastrophic mountaintop removal coal-mining sites in Pike County,I drove to Black Log Hollow in Martin County, where my paternal grandmother wasraised. When I pulled onto Black Log, something ineffable-without words anddeeper than memory, from a place so primal that it transcends thought andconscious action-tugged at my soul. I went unhesitatingly to the first mailboxon the right. The stenciled name read "Dalton," which was my paternalgrandmother's maiden name; I had found my great-grandparents' home and realizedthat folks to whom I am kin lived there yet. I called on the residents, andlike a clich�, the old woman inside accused me of being the law or a taxcollector. The only thing missing was a rifle across her lap.<br><br> These mountains can hold dark secrets. Mary BernadineDalton, who became my Mamaw Ciminella, never talked to me much about her familyor her years growing up. Her mother, Effie, was married at least five times.The husband who fathered Mamaw and her two sisters disappeared from the scene-shenever said why, at least to me, although Papaw Ciminella, who loved familydearly and was a devoted reminiscer, told me that my great-granddaddy had hitEffie and she'd ended that marriage on the spot. Mostly, what I knew was thatMamaw was a gorgeous mountain girl with a luscious figure who, like the KimNovak character in Picnic, fell for a charming, exotic outsider who lovedadventure.<br><br> Michael Lawrence Ciminella (Papaw) was the son ofSicilian immigrants who had settled in western New York, on the shores of LakeErie. His mother was a classic homemaker in the Italian tradition, his fatherhad a good job making wine for Welch's, and they were surrounded by a vibrantextended family. They raised five children together, including Papaw. But,according to my cousins, there was a dark side to this quintessential Americanstory. A family member had raped Papaw's mother, and his oldest brother wasconceived in incest. I can only imagine the suffering that created in Papaw'sfamily as he grew up, and it may explain why he developed ulcers that kept himout of military service during World War II. As a young man, Papaw, after hisexciting tenure in the Civilian Conservation Corps in the western states, whichallowed him to discover his love of rambling, installed copper roofing andgutters up and down the Appalachian Mountains. It was on one of these tripsthat he met the beautiful Billie Dalton at a clandestine juke joint in Inez,Kentucky. He swept her away from the local hero she was dating and married herin 1944, after a six-week courtship. They moved to Erie, Pennsylvania, where hefound a good job with General Electric building locomotives during the war. Myfather, Michael Charles Ciminella, who came along, was their only child.<br><br> After the war, Papaw and Mamaw briefly owned a diner inErie until Papaw, who used to play some serious poker, lost the business to oneof the local "hard guys" in a card game. His gambling days over (fora while, at least), Papaw moved his young family back to eastern Kentucky,where he worked as a brakeman for the C&amp;O Railroad. He was a wizard withall kinds of metalwork, and he eventually turned a part-time business buildingand installing gutters and siding into the successful Ashland Aluminum ProductsCompany.<br><br> Dad idolized his father, whom he remembers as outgoing,immensely competitive, hardworking, and honest. Papaw never lied or cheated tomake a sale, and he expected people to pay him when and what they owed him.Mamaw, in her early years, was as outgoing as Papaw. They were a beautiful andstylish couple, accomplished dancers who enjoyed socializing and golfing at thecountry club. But Dad's memory is that Mamaw grew more eccentric as she gotolder. She liked her house to be perfectly clean, neat, and orderly. She alsotended to fret, particularly about the health of her only child.<br><br> Dad had come down with a bad case of rheumatic fever as ayoung boy. It took him years to recuperate, and the family moved to Floridaduring the winters to help him heal. Mamaw must have been terrified of losinghim, because she nearly smothered him trying to keep him safe. He chafed at hervigilance, and when it came time for high school, he asked to go to Fork UnionMilitary Academy in Virginia to slip out from under her watchful eye. Dadthrived there, academically and athletically. The once sickly kid had turnedinto an outstanding baseball player, whose achievements were chronicled in thelocal paper and who briefly considered going pro. When he was sixteen, hisparents bought him a Corvair Monza so that he could drive himself back andforth to Ashland.<br><br> As soon as he received the car, Wendell Lyon, his bestfriend back home, enlisted him to drive him and his girlfriend, Linda McDonald,who would eventually become my godmother, to the movie theater over inHuntington, West Virginia. To seal the deal, Linda arranged a blind date forMichael with her pretty, fourteen-year-old across-the-street neighbor andfriend, Diana Judd.<br><br> Michael and Diana dated on and off for the next threeyears, and she has said that he first proposed marriage when she was onlyfifteen. She also claims she never loved him, but she enjoyed being taken ondates to the country club, and she was impressed by the comfortable lifestyleof the Ciminella family, which seemed luxurious compared with her family'shumbler circumstances.<br><br> Charles Glen Judd, my maternal papaw, came from a familythat didn't have much money, but they had laughter, stability, and love. He wasborn on Shirt Tail Fork of Little Blainecreek, alongside a farm that had beenin the family for generations. Papaw Judd and his folks moved to Ashlandbecause the job options in Lawrence County were coal mines or nothing. When hewas a senior in high school, he fell for a fourteen-year-old strawberry blondecashier named Pauline "Polly" Oliver.<br><br> Polly, my maternal grandmother, whom we call"Nana," came from a strange and troubled background. Her paternalgrandfather, David Oliver, had turned on the gas oven and then hanged himselfin front of his sons, aged only six and four, apparently because he wasdistraught that my great-great grandmother had left him. Howard, Nana's father,managed to save himself and his younger brother by breaking out a window.Howard, in turn, married a flophouse alcoholic party girl named Edie MaeBurton, who repeatedly cheated on him. When Nana was nine years old, her dadwas found in the bathroom with a bullet in his head; it looked like suicide,but everyone suspected Edie and her boyfriend. Edie took off soon after thefuneral, dumping Nana and her two younger siblings with her rigid, intimidatinggrandmother, Cora Lee Burton. Nana raised herself and her brother and sisteramong a collection of maladjusted grown aunts and uncles who were still livingat home, and she went to work at her grandmommy Cora Lee's restaurant, thelocally loved Hamburger Inn.<br><br> She was just fifteen when she married Glen Judd, and itmust have seemed like a good deal. Glen bought his own treasure of a gasstation and called it Judd's Friendly Ashland Service. When he and Nana startedhaving children, they bought his parents' big wood frame house at 2237Montgomery Avenue. Diana was the firstborn, followed two years later by Brian,then Mark, then Margaret.<br><br> My mother has always described her early childhood asidealized, happy, and secure, like a Norman Rockwell fantasy, with a stay-at-homemother who cooked wonderfully and a father she adored, who was hardworking andpopular in the community. For Nana, though, the marriage was no picnic. PapawJudd was a decent man who made a good living at the filling station, but he wasas tight with money as two coats of paint. Nana never had new clothes and didn'thave a washer and dryer until the youngest of their four children was out ofdiapers. When the furnace quit, Papaw Judd told Nana to fetch plastic from thedry cleaner's to insulate the windows. It was the only time Mom remembered hermother standing up to him about household finances. Papaw also worked longhours, often staying late to drink whiskey.<br><br> My mother describes herself as wildly imaginative and aperfectionist as a child, the kind of kid who always had her hand in the air atschool, earned good grades, and kept her room immaculate. She had neighborhoodfriends to play with in the humid summer evenings and siblings she loved,especially her gentle and funny younger brother Brian. Like all children, Mommust have absorbed the tension in the household, but she says the only thingshe missed as a child was the attention of her elusive father. While sheyearned for his affection, she learned to be noticed in other ways. Mom was aborn extrovert who used her babysitting money to take tap-dancing lessons. Andfolks around Ashland all say how popular and beautiful she was.</p><h2>The Devils of Loudun</h2><p><p> Aldous Huxley's acclaimed and gripping account of one of the strangest occurrences in history </p> <p> In 1643 an entire convent in the small French village of Loudun was apparently possessed by the devil.

Some students start writing, while others continue to sit still, look around the room, and, after a few minutes, raise their hands. "What should I write about?" "How do I get started?" "I'm just no good at writing." With that informal assessment, the teacher decides on an approach that will provide the students with the keys to unlocking the strategies and skills that good writers use. The teacher is confident that these students can learn to use the same powerful writing and self&#x2013;regulation strategies that good writers use. In this chapter, the instructional model for teaching composing and self&#x2013;regulation strategies, Self&#x2013;Regulated Strategy Development (SRSD), is presented. The major goals of SRSD are threefold:</p><ol><li> To assist students in mastering the higher&#x2013;level cognitive processes involved in the planning, production, revising, and editing of written language<br><br></li><li> To help students further develop the ability to monitor and manage their own writing<br><br></li><li> To aid students in the development of positive attitudes and beliefs about writing and about themselves as writers<br><br></li></ol>Many students have experienced a great deal of frustration, failure, or anxiety when faced with writing assignments. For these students, the development of positive attitudes and beliefs is essential. These attitudes and beliefs develop as the students learn powerful strategies that improve their writing. There is a great deal of truth in the old adage, "Nothing succeeds like success." To help students master writing strategies and use them effectively, the SRSD approach includes the development of skillful use of effective writing strategies, self&#x2013;regulation of the writing process, and knowledge of one's own cognitive processes and other learning characteristics and an understanding of the potential and limitations of the strategies they learn.<p></p><p>Self&#x2013;regulation of strategic performance and knowledge about the strategies are important in helping students</p><ul><li> Understand how and when to apply a strategy<br><br></li><li> Independently produce, evaluate, and modify a strategy in an effective manner<br><br></li><li> Recognize meaningful improvement in skills, processes, and products<br><br></li><li> Gain new insights regarding strategies and their own strategic performance<br></li><li> Improve their expectations of and attitudes regarding themselves as writers<br><br></li><li> Maintain and generalize strategic performance<br><br></li></ul><p><b>STAGES OF INSTRUCTION</b></p><p></p><p>In the SRSD approach, six basic stages of instruction are used to develop and integrate use of the strategy and self&#x2013;regulation components. SRSD has been successfully used with entire classes, small groups, individual students, and in tutoring settings. Throughout these stages, teachers and students collaborate on the acquisition, implementation, evaluation, and modification of strategies. These stages are not meant to be followed in a "cookbook" fashion. Instead, they provide a general format and guidelines. The instructional stages are meant to be recursive, teachers may return to any stage at any time. The stages may be reordered, combined, or modified as needed to meet student and teacher needs. In fact, as will be seen in the lesson plans in this book, the first two stages (Develop Background Knowledge and Discuss It) are typically combined in the first lessons. Some stages may not be needed by all students. Some students may already have the background knowledge needed to use the writing strategy and self&#x2013;regulation processes and may therefore skip this stage or act as a resource for other students who need this stage. Finally, lessons have typically run anywhere from 20 to 60 minutes (depending on grade level and class schedules) at least three times a week. Typically, in the elementary grades, 8 to 12 lessons running 30 to 40 minutes each have proven sufficient to allow students to complete the stages. More complex strategies may take longer in middle or high school.</p><p><b>Generalization and Maintenance</b></p><p>Procedures for promoting maintenance and generalization are integrated throughout the stages of instruction in the SRSD model. These include</p><ul><li>Identifying opportunities to use the writing and/or self&#x2013;regulation strategies in other classes or settings<br><br></li><li>Discussing attempts to use the strategies at other times<br><br></li><li>Reminding students to use the strategies at appropriate times<br><br></li><li>Analyzing how these processes may be modified with other tasks and in new settings<br><br></li><li>Evaluating the success of these processes during and after instruction It is helpful to involve others (e.g., other teachers, parents) as they can prompt the use of the strategies at appropriate times in other settings. Booster sessions in which the strategies are reviewed, discussed, and supported are very important for most students in terms of maintaining the strategies.<br><br></li></ul><p><b>Self&#x2013;Efficacy</b></p><p>Students who have experienced significant learning problems frequently develop negative beliefs and expectations that result in low motivation, attitudinal problems, and lessened effort. Repeated failure can result in feelings of helplessness. These students believe that further effort will have little effect, even when the task is doable. Self&#x2013;efficacy is believed to have a strong influence on performance as it affects a person's choice of activities, the amount of effort expended, and the degree of persistence one demonstrates in the face of difficulty. Students who believe they are capable of successful performance are likely to choose challenging activities, work hard, and persist when difficulties are encountered. Throughout SRSD, self&#x2013;efficacy is supported and developed.</p><p></p>A brief overview of the six stages of instruction in SRSD is presented in Table 2.1.<p></p><p>Each stage is discussed in detail and then followed by an example of SRSD in the classroom. The stages of instruction, however, represent merely the framework of instruction. Thus, this description is followed by a discussion of critical characteristics of SRSD instruction and guidelines for evaluation of this process.</p><p><b>STAGE 1: DEVELOP BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE</b></p><p>During this stage, background knowledge and any preskills (e.g., vocabulary, concepts) students need for learning and using the writing or self&#x2013;regulation strategies are developed. For example, if students are going to learn a story&#x2013;writing strategy (e.g., the Who, When, and Where [WWW] strategy for story writing included in this book), they must understand the vocabulary related to story parts, including who, when, and where, or for older students, setting and characters. Preskills and background knowledge should be developed far enough to allow students to move into the next stages. Their development can continue into Stages 2 (Discuss It) and 3 (Model It); however, it is usually best if preskills are mastered by Stage 4 (Memorize It). Background knowledge and preskill development activities depend on the learner and the knowledge and skills that must be developed. These skills can be developed in regard to both the composition and self&#x2013;regulation strategies that are to be mastered.</p><p>The concept and use of self&#x2013;instructions are often introduced in Stage 1. The teacher and students might collaboratively create self&#x2013;instructions relevant to composition. For example, a student who tends to act impulsively might say to himself, "Remember, I need to take my time and go slow." A student with a low tolerance for frustration might say, "I'm not going to get mad. Getting mad makes me do bad." Students can practice using such self&#x2013;instructions in a variety of situations as a part of preskill development; these self&#x2013;instructions can then be incorporated into the later stages of strategies instruction. This may be particularly helpful for students who have not previously learned to use self&#x2013;instructions.</p><p>In addition, the teacher can discuss with students how the things they say to themselves can either help or hurt them. Students might discuss the self&#x2013;speech they currently use when asked to write and whether it helps them or needs to be changed. Negative or ineffective self&#x2013;statements such as "I'm no good at this" or "I hate writing" can be identified, and the ways these statements interfere with performance can be discussed.</p><p><b>STAGE 2: DISCUSS IT</b></p><p>During this stage, the teacher and students discuss the <i>significance</i> and <i>benefits</i> of the writing and self&#x2013;regulation strategies to be learned. Each step in the writing strategy is discussed, as are any mnemonics to be used. The importance of student effort in strategy mastery is also emphasized. Throughout instruction, it is essential that students recognize and discuss the role of effort in learning and using strategies, and that they see their efforts paying off in better writing. This emphasis on knowing more about the strategy and how it works, along with student effort, helps set the stage for the development of positive attitudes about writing. The goals of strategies instruction are discussed and determined. This stage enables students to make a commitment to strategy mastery and participation as a partner/collaborator while helping to establish motivation.</p><p>Along with their teacher, students may also examine their current performance on the targeted composing skill. Compositions from students' portfolios or those written before strategies instruction began can be read and analyzed. For example, if the story grammar strategy has been discussed, students' selected stories can be analyzed to see how many common story elements are included. In addition, students may graph the number of elements present in their stories. Graphing of current performance can help set the stage for both goal setting and self&#x2013;monitoring. If current performance is examined to help set the stage for strategies instruction, it should be done in a positive, collaborative manner with the teacher stressing that students were not expected to have all the common story parts when these stories were written because they hadn't yet learned the strategy.</p><p>The teacher and students also discuss how and when to use the strategy. This discussion should not be limited to the writing task at hand. At this time, students can begin to identify opportunities to use the strategy in new situations or for other appropriate tasks (e.g., the story grammar strategy might be useful in writing a book report). However, the teacher should be sure that the proposed benefits of the strategy are expressed reasonably so that students do not develop unreasonable expectations. In addition, the teacher and students should discuss writing tasks in which this strategy would <i>not</i> be useful (e.g., the story&#x2013;writing strategy would not be useful for writing a science report).</p><p><b>STAGE 3: MODEL IT</b></p><p>During this stage, the teacher or a peer models the composing strategy and selected types of self&#x2013;instructions, thinking aloud while writing an actual composition. Types of self&#x2013;instructions that can be introduced include problem definition (<i>What is it? What do I have to do here?</i>), focusing attention and planning (<i>I need to concentrate. First I need to . . . then . . .</i>), strategy step statements (<i>I need to write down my strategy reminder</i>), self&#x2013;evaluation and error correcting (Have I used all of my parts? Oops! I missed one. I'd better add it), coping and self&#x2013;control (<i>I can handle this. I need to go slow and take my time</i>), and self&#x2013;reinforcement (<i>I like this ending!</i>). All of these forms should not be introduced at once. Instead, teachers should select types of statements and model statements specific to the needs and characteristics of their students. It is also important that the model demonstrate coping with difficulty, such as having trouble thinking what to do next or forgetting a strategy step, and then model how one successfully deals with a particular difficulty. Students can help the teacher when difficulties are encountered.</p><p></p><p>If students initially use prompts (they are typically used, as will be seen in the lesson plans), such as a graphic or chart listing the strategy steps or detailing a mnemonic and a graphic organizer for writing, the model should use them as well. The teacher can also set a goal for her or his composition, such as including all seven story parts, and evaluate the composition to see if that goal was met. Students can also be involved in the writing process by helping the teacher or peer model during planning and writing.</p><p>After self&#x2013;regulation of the writing strategy has been modeled, the teacher and students should discuss the importance of the self&#x2013;statements used during modeling as well as the goal setting and self&#x2013;assessment. At this point, students typically begin developing their preferred self&#x2013;instructions, recording them on paper or on bulletin boards. These self&#x2013;instructions will be used in later stages; modeling, reexplanation, and further development of self&#x2013;instructions can occur in later stages as needed. Teachers and students can discuss the strategy steps and instructional components and then collaboratively decide if any changes are needed to make the strategy more effective and efficient. This can be discussed again in later stages. Generalization of the strategy to other tasks and settings can also be discussed further.</p><p>Teachers who have used SRSD have either creatively augmented live modeling or come up with alternatives. One teacher who was uncomfortable with modeling from memory or from notes when he first began strategy instruction came up with an innovative approach that worked well for him and his students. He worked out his modeling script, making sure he had all of the components, steps, and self&#x2013;instructions he wished to model. He then put his self&#x2013;talk on audiotape, reading from the script but speaking naturally and appropriately. He played this tape with his writing group, using the overhead projector to simultaneously plan for a composition. When modeling planning using the strategy prompt and graphic organizer was completed, the teacher and his students collaboratively wrote the actual composition, using the notes generated while modeling. In addition, teachers have successfully incorporated videotapes of peers who have already learned the strategies modeling their use of the writing and selfregulation strategies.</p><p>One of the aspects of modeling that makes it such a powerful procedure is the extent to which the model's performance can be i...</p></p><h2>Modeling Clay Animals: Easy-to-Follow Projects in Simple Steps</h2><p>Preschool and early-grades boys and girls will discover a wealth of creative fun when they open this book.

Parents and teachers will also appreciate this fun approach to learning, and will have a wonderful time helping kids develop their creative natures.</p><p>(back cover) <br> With this step-by-step book, children will have fun creating beautiful animal figures out of modeling clay. All techniques described are easy for children to master, and kids will be delighted by the wonderful array of animals they can fashion when they start out with simple balls and sausages of clay. Parents and teachers will also appreciate this fun approach to art instruction, and will have a wonderful time helping kids develop their creative talents. <br> <br> <br> <br>Gr 2-5&#x2013;In this well-put-together resource, Cuxart shows readers how to make more than 50 different figures using clay and other materials. The book begins with basic tips and instructions and then devotes a page or two to each of the projects. The animals are arranged roughly by habitat, with sea creatures followed by jungle animals, farm animals, and insects. For each one there are illustrated step-by-step instructions and a photo of the final product. The instructions are primarily visual and are accompanied by a sentence or two of text. They are very clear, and even fairly young children should be able to follow the directions without much adult intervention. Some of the final products are more stylized than others, but all are appealing. The projects are designed to be made with nondrying clay, although they could be adapted for use with other mediums. Printed on heavy paper, the book has bright color illustrations and uncluttered white backgrounds. These projects are simpler and less stylized than those in Maureen Carlson's Clay Characters for Kids (North Light, 2003). A good choice for craft-book collections.&#x2013;Donna Cardon, Provo City Library, UT. (c) Copyright 2010. Library Journals LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Media Source, Inc.

Her mother cries constantly, and her father barely lets Bethany out of his sight. Then one morning he hustles the entire family into the car, drives across several state lines -- and leaves Bethany with an aunt she never knew existed. Bethany has no idea what's going on. She's worried her mom and dad are running from some kind of trouble, but she can't find out because they won't tell her where they are going. <br> <br> Bethany's only clue is a few words she overheard her father tell her aunt: "She doesn't know anything about Elizabeth." But Aunt Myrlie won't tell Bethany who Elizabeth is, and she won't explain why people in her small town react to Bethany as if they've seen a ghost. The mystery intensifies when Bethany gets a package from her father containing four different birth certificates from four different states, with four different last names -- and thousands of dollars in cash. And when a strange man shows up asking questions, Bethany realizes the's not the only one who's desperate to unravel the secrets of her past.</p><p>Margaret Peterson Haddix is the author of many critically and popularly acclaimed YA and middle grade novels, including the Children of Exile series, The Missing series, the Under Their Skin series, and the Shadow Children series.

The author of <i>Escape from Memory</i> (2003) and the Shadow Children series has penned another suspenseful sf novel guaranteed to keep readers riveted. After her mother suffers a nervous breakdown, 12-year-old Bethany Cole is deposited with Myrlie Wilker, an aunt of whom she has never heard. Myrlie and several other residents of Sanderfield, Illinois, do a double take when they see Bethany--for she reminds them of Elizabeth, Bethany's heretofore-unknown older sister, who died some 20 years earlier. In carefully crafted, gripping prose, Haddix slowly reveals the family secrets that have been kept from Bethany all these years: her sister's death, her parent's desperate grief, and the deal they made with a wealthy businessman. The ending is a little too neat, but Haddix's fans aren't likely to notice; secondary themes concerning cloning ethics and personal identity are also nicely handled, which makes this a good companion to Nancy Werlin's <i>Double Helix</i> (2004). <i>Kay Weisman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Anna has developed a six-stage process that really works. Plus this book is full of professional tips. There's information for beginners but also a challenge for those with some experience. There are step by step projects and gorgeous finished work. This is a beautiful book and Anna's warm personality and immense talent shines on every page. Highly recommended for any watercolour flower painter and botanical artists. * Karen Platt Yarnsandfabrics.co.uk/crafts * October 2014 This book covers every aspect of modern stye botanical flowers painted in watercolours, from tips on gathering materials to how to handle the paint. There are six projects in the book, each shown step-by-step with outline drawings, tonal notes and useful colour swatches. From delicate bluebells, exotic orchids, feathery tulips, papery poppies, and romantic roses, all build into a fantastic guide that will inspire and challenge the experienced watercolour artist, while also drawing in and reassuring the complete beginner. * My Weekly * November 2014 This comprehensive book provides a little more detail in the method of painting than some previous guides to botanical illustration. Anna's six-stage process starts with the highlights, which are usually at the centre of the main flower and works outwards from there, adding tones and contrasts before putting in the final details. In the demonstrations, each stage may have more than one step, so there are no large jumps that leave you wondering what happened in between. There is a good balance between the basics of flower painting and the specifics of individual examples. The book is nicely places between the introductory guides and the more advanced titles that assume a considerable degree of prior experience and sometimes sacrifice detail for quantity of subjects and species - Henry Malt. * Artist, The * May 14 The first book from regular Artists &amp; Illustrators contributor Anna Mason highlights her refreshingly contemporary approach to botanical painting, which sees many of the subjects appear to bloom before your very eyes. Anna begins by laying out her thoughts on paint consistency, brush techniques and mixing hues, giving newcomers the building blocks required to tackle a full painting with confidence. By the completion of the six step-by-step projects, you will be surprised at how far you have progressed. * Artists &amp; Illustrators, The * May 14 As this is one of Search Press' occasional hardcover books, expect a visual treat and something rather special. Flowers lend themselves to lushly illustrated large format books like this one and this book lives up to its subtitle of "creating vibrant botanical portraits in watercolour". The book is in two halves, firstly getting to grips with the materials and secondly several staged paintings to work through. You can find some outlines at the back to trace so here is a nod to the popular Ready To Paint series that ought to work well with beginners, and those new to watercolor. The pictures here are well described as portraits, and combine the botanical appearance of old prints with a modern, vibrantly colorful approach. There are all the usual features in here from what you need to buy to color wheels, perspective, mixing colors etc, as well as intriguing sections on learning to see, getting the paint consistency right, laying out a palette and creating tone and hue. I don't think I have seen such an in-depth look at the medium before and it certainly bears reading and having a go even if you think you are past that stage. The author then shows us her six stage method of painting and works though a picture of a rose, before going onto the six staged projects which are handily arranged in order of difficulty. If you can't get onto a real course here is the next best thing. * Myshelf.com * November 2014 This comprehensive book provides a little more detail in the method of painting than some previous guides to botanical illustration.

There is a good balance between the basics of flower painting and the specifics of individual examples. The book is nicely placed between the introductory guides and the more advanced titles that assume a considerable degree of prior experience and sometime sacrifice detail for quantity of subjects an species. * Artist, The * Apr 14 This really rather attractive book is pitched somewhere between the basic guides to flower painting and the more technical botanical illustration works. Anna Mason's technique involves a six-stage process that starts with the highlights, which are normally in the centre of the flower, and works outwards, adding details, tints and contrasts so that shapes and depth are built up progressively while preserving the main form. There is also plenty of information on painting methods and the use of colour, but these assume a reasonable amount of basic knowledge, so that you don't spend half the book wading through stuff you should know already. The overall approach is busy and varied and the concentration is on the painting rather than the flowers - that's to say, it's about creating a work of art rather than recording a specific species. There is, however, plenty of variety (more than varieties) and examples of different flower types, shapes and colours. If you're looking for a book that takes you on from the basics but isn't obsessed with botanical details, this would be perfect. The demonstrations, while working within the aforementioned six-stage process, have a reasonable number of steps so that while you're not shown every brushstroke, neither are you pitched from one completed section to another and wondering how you got there. * Artbookreview.net * October 2014 Anna Mason is an award winning artist and is a board member of the Society of Botanical Artists.

What&#x2019;s the difference between permitting something and ordaining it? When bad things happen, who&#x2019;s behind them--God or the devil? When suffering touches our lives, questions like these suddenly demand an answer. From our perspective, suffering doesn&#x2019;t make sense, especially when we believe in a loving and just God. After more than thirty years in a wheelchair, Joni Eareckson Tada&#x2019;s intimate experience with suffering gives her a special understanding of God&#x2019;s intentions for us in our pain. In When God Weeps, she and lifelong friend Steven Estes probe beyond glib answers that fail us in our time of deepest need. Instead, with firmness and compassion, they reveal a God big enough to understand our suffering, wise enough to allow it&#x2014;and powerful enough to use it for a greater good than we can ever imagine</p></p><p><p>It's easy to trust God when things are going our way and the world makes sense. But when suffering strikes--especially seemingly senseless suffering--we are filled with doubt and stunned by events spiraling beyond our control. In the midst of suffering, we often question the very foundation of our faith--our belief in the God who says he loves us. </p><p>Since our trust and obedience rest on God's character, the questions that life's tragedies force us to face are difficult, even frightening. Who is God? Can he really be trusted? What are his purposes in the face of suffering? If he can stop suffering, why doesn't he? </p><p>Joni Eareckson Tada, a woman who has lived in a wheelchair for more than thirty years, and Steve Estes, a pastor and one of Joni's closest friends, explore the answers. When God Weeps is not so much a book about suffering as it is about God. It tackles tough questions about heaven and hell, horrors and hardships, and why God allows suffering in this life. </p><p>Through a panoramic overview of what the Bible says about suffering, the authors make clear who God is, why he permits so much heartache and pain, and how it is we can trust him. With both a practical edge and heartfelt warmth, When God Weeps offers a message of deep reliance on God--and keys to a radical, life-transforming dependence on his love and mercy in spite of our doubts, fears, longings, and questions. </p><p>It's a message much needed. Despair and discouragement are rampant. At the same time, fewer people are able to balance God's purposes and his mercies. Instead, attempting to avoid tragedy and suffering, many Christians confuse simple formulas for faith. But where does that leave the family who loses a son on a military mission? Or the young mother who isn't healed of cancer? </p><p>When God Weeps is for people like these . . . and for thousands more who need more--much more--than answers.</p>Joni Eareckson Tada, having been tutored in God's Word amidst the bruising reality of quadriplegia for over 30 years, is the author of over twenty books dealing with God's hand in hardship.

Kittridge, known to the world as &#x201c;Last Stand in Denver,&#x201d; has been forced to flee his stronghold and is now on the road, dodging the infected, armed but alone and well aware that a tank of gas will get him only so far.

The better question would be: Where don&#x2019;t I?</p> <p>Many people know that <em>The Passage</em> was born from a challenge laid down by my eight-year-old daughter to write the story of &#x201c;a girl who saves the world.&#x201d; This wasn&#x2019;t exactly what I wanted to hear&#x2014;it seemed a trifle ambitious&#x2014;but a dare is a dare. For the next three months she joined me on my daily jog, following along on her bicycle, while the two of us hashed out the plot. As the weeks passed, I realized we were onto something much better than the book I was supposed to be writing. I put that book aside, wrote the first chapter of <em>The Passage</em>, and never looked back. </p> <p>So don&#x2019;t ever think you shouldn&#x2019;t listen to your kids.</p> <p>But my daughter&#x2019;s challenge wasn&#x2019;t the only inspiration. When I write a novel, my goal is to put absolutely everything I have into its pages, right down to the interesting thing that happened yesterday. I know I&#x2019;m done when my mind feels as empty as a leaky bucket. So many influences, real and imagined, went into <em>The Passage</em> that I couldn&#x2019;t list them if I tried. But one memory that stands out is the night my family and I tried to flee Houston in advance of hurricane Rita. Apparently, about a million other people had the same idea. After five hours on the road, we&#x2019;d made it all of sixty miles. The highways were clogged with cars that had long since run out of gas; every minimart and gas station had been picked clean. I jumped the median and made it home in a little under an hour, my gas gauge floating just above &#x2018;E&#x2019;.</p> <p>Rita missed Houston, slamming into a less-inhabited section of Texas and Louisiana coastline. But the experience of being in a large urban evacuation, with its feeling of barely-bottled panic, was one I&#x2019;ll never forget, and is everywhere in the pages of <em>The Passage</em>.</p> <p>So where did <em>The Twelve</em> come from?</p> <p>Again, many places. But if I had to pick one source, it would be the strong women in my life. No bones about it: Gentlemen, if you doubt for a second that women are tougher than we are, go watch one have a baby. So here you have Alicia, the woman warrior with her blades and crossbow; here you have Amy, the spiritual leader and visionary; here you have one of my favorite new characters, Lore DeVeer, whose mechanical savvy is matched only by her unbridled sensuality; here you have a fourth woman (sorry, can&#x2019;t tell you who) whose maternal strength is as powerful as any great spectacle of nature. As I wrote <em>The Twelve</em>, I came to understand that these powerful characters were the backbone of the tale. Even more, they are a tribute to all the amazing women I am privileged to know, befriend, and in one very lucky instance, marry.</p> <p>Hope you enjoy <em>The Twelve</em>.

An excerpt of the book was hailed by Tibor Fisher in the <i>Guardian</i> as right up there with <i>Catch-22</i> and Michael Herr&#x2019;s <i>Dispatches</i>,&#x201d; and the book won Russia&#x2019;s inaugural Debut Prize, which recognizes authors who write despite, not because of, their life circumstances.&#x201d; In 1995, Arkady Babchenko was an eighteen-year-old law student in Moscow when he was drafted into the Russian army and sent to Chechnya. It was the beginning of a torturous journey from na�ve conscript to hardened soldier that took Babchenko from the front lines of the first Chechen War in 1995 to the second in 1999. He fought in major cities and tiny hamlets, from the bombed-out streets of Grozny to anonymous mountain villages. Babchenko takes the raw and mundane realities of war the constant cold, hunger, exhaustion, filth, and terror and twists it into compelling, haunting, and eerily elegant prose. Acclaimed by reviewers around the world, this is a devastating first-person account of war by an extraordinary storyteller.</p><p>No Bio<br><br>No Bio<br><br>No Bio<p>Reviewed by Thomas de Waal</p><p>All wars pervert language and our sense of reality, but Russia's war in Chechnya was especially grotesque.</p><p>In 1994, in the most opportunistic fashion, President Boris Yeltsin sent the Russian army to crush a secessionist government in the southern province of Chechnya. Ostensibly, the army's task was to "restore constitutional order" and "disarm bandits." But to correspondents covering the conflict, it was obvious that Yeltsin's decision would be a catastrophe, for one reason above all others: The Russian armed forces were a frightening rabble of unruly men.</p><p>Far from restoring constitutional order, the soldiers abused every article of Russia's young constitution, looting, raping and killing in what was supposed to be part of their own country. One day in 1995, I met a young Chechen businessman who explained how the armed forces were fulfilling the second part of Yeltsin's orders, the "disarming" of the populace. He rummaged through a wardrobe in his house and pulled out a wad of $100 bills -- $5,000 in all -- that he said he had agreed to pay two soldiers for a consignment of Russian army snipers' rifles, grenade-launchers and ammunition (which would, of course, pass quickly into the hands of Chechen insurgents). </p><p>In One Soldier's War, his memoir of Russian army life, Arkady Babchenko confirms that this kind of sale was rife. He describes how two new recruits were beaten, tortured and expelled from his unit for selling ammunition through the fence of their base to buy vodka. But their real mistake was not that they traded with the enemy. It was that they were new:</p><p>"We don't watch the beating. We have been beaten ourselves and it has long ceased to be of any interest. Nor do we feel particularly sorry for the gunners. They shouldn't have gotten caught. . . . They have seen too little of the war to sell bullets -- only we are entitled to do that. We know death, we've heard it whistling over our heads and seen how it mangles bodies, and we have the right to bring it upon others. And these two haven't. What's more, the new recruits are strangers in our battalion, not yet soldiers, not one of us. But most of all we are upset that we can no longer use the gap in the fence." </p><p>At moments like this, One Soldier's War evokes Catch-22 or, closer to the source, the savage ironies of Isaac Babel's tales of the 1919-21 Russian-Polish war, Red Cavalry.</p><p>Babchenko went to war having learned Morse code but not how to use a gun. He and his fellow conscripts were systematically hazed and humiliated by senior soldiers; they sold their boots for cabbage pies and treated a stray dog as a lucky feast; they were filled with hatred and nihilism:</p><p>"We stopped caring for ourselves, no longer washed, shaved or brushed our teeth. After a week without soap and water our hands cracked and bled continually, blighted by eczema in the cold. We hadn't warmed ourselves by a fire for a whole week because the damp reeds wouldn't burn and there was nowhere to gather firewood in the steppe. We began to turn wild as the cold and wet and filth drove from us all feelings apart from hatred, and we hated everything on earth, including ourselves." </p><p>The memoir, by turns horrific, sad and funny, fills a big gap by providing us with the first-person experiences of an articulate Russian soldier. As one tale of savagery follows another, however, the story becomes increasingly frustrating to the reader who knows the Russian political context. The end of one war, a two-year interlude and the start of a second war are barely registered as the narrative becomes war-without-end, totally enclosed within a soldier's helmet and a company of men.</p><p>We never learn why Babchenko, a conscript in the first Chechen war, from 1994 to 1996, volunteered to fight again in 1999. And there are even more troubling omissions. One is President Vladimir Putin, who -- in contrast to his predecessor, the bumbling Boris Yeltsin -- never is mentioned by name. The other is the civilian population of Chechnya. The soldiers routinely used the word "Chechens" to mean rebel fighters, the enemy. Babchenko suffered mental torment when it became clear he ordered artillery fire that killed an 8-year-old girl and her grandfather, but usually he sounds strangely uninterested in the suffering of the Chechen civilians, the main victims of Yeltsin's and Putin's wars.</p><p>War is not just an existential experience for young men. It is the ultimate test for a society, forcing its citizens to ask if they can trust their government to dispense death in their name. That is a question Babchenko never addresses in this harrowing but rather self-absorbed memoir. </p><p></p><p></p><p><br>Copyright 2008, The Washington Post.

Even before the written word, the ancients established a Divine partnership between humans and these Hidden Realms. Both agreed to form an eternal Sacred Alliance to establish harmony and balance between the material and the spiritual. The Alliance ensured that when we asked for guidance in manifesting our reality, they would help us find our way to the highest good for all. But in time, humanity turned itself away from the natural world as a source for the Divine and forgot about the realms in the Unseen realities. Religious superstition, dominance, and the power of intellect, reason, and technology became our focus; and our partnership was forgotten, so the realms faded away. As our global concerns have increasingly been more plaintive, they have returned to help us find our way home to our true purpose, prosperity, hope, and happiness.These cards represent some of those realms and their Queens and Kings, Princes, and other magical helpers. Let the Swan Queen point the way to transformation, the Arrow Master help you reach your goals, the Sun Dancers herald your victories, and the Sacred Union speak to the depth of your longing for love. Ask and ye shall receive, for the Highest Good is their motto.

Now, after over three decades of studying and teaching Isaiah, Alec Motyer presents a wealth of commentary and perspective on this book. His emphasis is on the grammatical, historical, structural, literary and theological dimensions of the text. Though based on the Hebrew text, his exposition easily accomodates readers without a working knowledge of biblical Hebrew. And he writes with an interest in Isaiah's meaning for Christians today. Along the historical timeline on which the Isaianic prophecies are strung, Motyer finds three central and recurring themes: the messianic hope, the motif of the city and the theology of the Holy One of Israel. Moreover, he argues, the Isaianic literature is organized around three messianic portraits: the King (Isaiah 1-37), the Servant (Isaiah 38-55) and the Anointed Conqueror (Isaiah 56-66). Preachers, teachers and serious Bible students of all types will find this commentary a wise, winsome and welcome guide to the prophecy of Isaiah. It may easily be the best one-volume evangelical commentary on Isaiah available today.</p><p>J. Alec Motyer (1924&#x2013;2016) was a renowned Old Testament pastor and scholar. With extensive experience in parish ministry, he was principal of Trinity College in Bristol, England, and was well known as a Bible expositor. His books include <em>The Prophecy of Isaiah</em>, and he was the Old Testament editor of The Bible Speaks Today commentary series."Motyer's greatest contribution yet to Old Testament scholarship."

They set forth at daybreak to see a man beheaded, twenty in all, and Bran rode among them, nervous with excitement. This was the first time he had been deemed old enough to go with his lord father and his brothers to see the king's justice done. It was the ninth year of summer, and the seventh of Bran's life.<br><br>The man had been taken outside a small holdfast in the hills. Robb thought he was a wildling, his sword sworn to Mance Rayder, the King-beyond-the-Wall. It made Bran's skin prickle to think of it. He remembered the hearth tales Old Nan told them. The wildlings were cruel men, she said, slavers and slayers and thieves. They consorted with giants and ghouls, stole girl children in the dead of night, and drank blood from polished horns. And their women lay with the Others in the Long Night to sire terrible half-human children.<br><br>But the man they found bound hand and foot to the holdfast wall awaiting the king's justice was old and scrawny, not much taller than Robb. He had lost both ears and a finger to frostbite, and he dressed all in black, the same as a brother of the Night's Watch, except that his furs were ragged and greasy.<br><br>The breath of man and horse mingled, steaming, in the cold morning air as his lord father had the man cut down from the wall and dragged before them. Robb and Jon sat tall and still on their horses, with Bran between them on his pony, trying to seem older than seven, trying to pretend that he'd seen all this before. A faint wind blew through the holdfast gate. Over their heads flapped the banner of the Starks of Winterfell: a grey direwolf racing across an ice-white field.<br><br>Bran's father sat solemnly on his horse, long brown hair stirring in the wind. His closely trimmed beard was shot with white, making him look older than his thirty-five years. He had a grim cast to his grey eyes this day, and he seemed not at all the man who would sit before the fire in the evening and talk softly of the age of heroes and the children of the forest. He had taken off Father's face, Bran thought, and donned the face of Lord Stark of Winterfell.<br><br>There were questions asked and answers given there in the chill of morning, but afterward Bran could not recall much of what had been said. Finally his lord father gave a command, and two of his guardsmen dragged the ragged man to the ironwood stump in the center of the square. They forced his head down onto the hard black wood. Lord Eddard Stark dismounted and his ward Theon Greyjoy brought forth the sword. "Ice," that sword was called. It was as wide across as a man's hand, and taller even than Robb. The blade was Valyrian steel, spell-forged and dark as smoke. Nothing held an edge like Valyrian steel.<br><br>His father peeled off his gloves and handed them to Jory Cassel, the captain of his household guard. He took hold of Ice with both hands and said, "In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, by the word of Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, I do sentence you to die." He lifted the great sword high above his head.<br><br>Bran's bastard brother Jon Snow moved closer. "Keep the pony well in hand," he whispered. "And don't look away. Father will know if you do."<br><br>Bran kept his pony well in hand, and did not look away.<br>His father took off the man's head with a single sure stroke. Blood sprayed out across the snow, as red as summerwine. One of the horses reared and had to be restrained to keep from bolting. Bran could not take his eyes off the blood. The snows around the stump drank it eagerly, reddening as he watched.<br><br>The head bounced off a thick root and rolled. It came up near Greyjoy's feet. Theon was a lean, dark youth of nineteen who found everything amusing. He laughed, put his boot on the head,and kicked it away.<br><br>"Ass," Jon muttered, low enough so Greyjoy did not hear. He put a hand on Bran's shoulder, and Bran looked over at his bastard brother. <br><br>"You did well," Jon told him solemnly. Jon was fourteen, an old hand at justice.<br><br>It seemed colder on the long ride back to Winterfell, though the wind had died by then and the sun was higher in the sky. Bran rode with his brothers, well ahead of the main party, his pony struggling hard to keep up with their horses.<br><br>"The deserter died bravely," Robb said. He was big and broad and growing every day, with his mother's coloring, the fair skin, red-brown hair, and blue eyes of the Tullys of Riverrun. "He had courage, at the least."<br><br>"No," Jon Snow said quietly. "It was not courage. This one was dead of fear. You could see it in his eyes, Stark." Jon's eyes were a grey so dark they seemed almost black, but there was little they did not see. He was of an age with Robb, but they did not look alike. Jon was slender where Robb was muscular, dark where Robb was fair, graceful and quick where his half brother was strong and fast.<br><br>Robb was not impressed. "The Others take his eyes," he swore. "He died well. Race you to the bridge?"<br><br>"Done," Jon said, kicking his horse forward. Robb cursed and followed, and they galloped off down the trail, Robb laughing and hooting, Jon silent and intent. The hooves of their horses kicked up showers of snow as they went.<br><br>Bran did not try to follow. His pony could not keep up. He had seen the ragged man's eyes, and he was thinking of them now. After a while, the sound of Robb's laughter receded, and the woods grew silent again.<br><br>That was when Jon reappeared on the crest of the hill before them. He waved and shouted down at them. <i>"Father, Bran, come quickly, see what Robb has found!"</i> Then he was gone again.<br><br>Jory rode up beside them. "Trouble, my lord?"<br><br>"Beyond a doubt," his lord father said. "Come, let us see what mischief my sons have rooted out now." He sent his horse into a trot. Jory and Bran and the rest came after.<br><br>They found Robb on the riverbank north of the bridge, with Jon still mounted beside him. The late summer snows had been heavy this moonturn. Robb stood knee-deep in white, his hood pulled back so the sun shone in his hair. He was cradling something in his arm, while the boys talked in hushed, excited voices.<br><br>The riders picked their way carefully through the drifts, groping for solid footing on the hidden, uneven ground. Jory Cassel and Theon Greyjoy were the first to reach the boys. Greyjoy was laughing and joking as he rode. Bran heard the breath go out of him. <i>"Gods!"</i> he exclaimed, struggling to keep control of his horse as he reached for his sword.<br><br>Jory's sword was already out. "Robb, get away from it!" he called as his horse reared under him.<br><br>Robb grinned and looked up from the bundle in his arms. "She can't hurt you," he said. "She's dead, Jory."<br><br>Bran was afire with curiosity by then. He would have spurred the pony faster, but his father made them dismount beside the bridge and approach on foot. Bran jumped off and ran.<br><br>By then Jon, Jory, and Theon Greyjoy had all dismounted as well. "What in the seven hells is it?" Greyjoy was saying.<br><br>"A wolf," Robb told him.<br><br>"A freak," Greyjoy said. "Look at the <i>size</i> of it."<br><br>Bran's heart was thumping in his chest as he pushed through a waist-high drift to his brothers' side.<br><br>Half-buried in blood stained snow, a huge dark shape slumped in death. Ice had formed in its shaggy grey fur, and the faint smell of corruption clung to it like a woman's perfume. Bran glimpsed blind eyes crawling with maggots, a wide mouth full of yellowed teeth. But it was the size of it that made him gasp. It was bigger than his pony, twice the size of the largest hound in his father's kennel.<br><br>"It's no freak," Jon said calmly. "That's a direwolf. They grow larger than the other kind."<br><br>Theon Greyjoy said, "There's not been a direwolf sighted south of the Wall in two hundred years."<br><br>"I see one now," Jon replied.<br><br>Bran tore his eyes away from the monster. That was when he noticed the bundle in Robb's arms. He gave a cry of delight and moved closer. The pup was a tiny ball of grey-black fur, its eyes still closed. It nuzzled blindly against Robb's chest as he cradled it, searching for milk among his leathers, making a sad little whimpery sound. Bran reached out hesitantly. "Go on,"Robb told him. "You can touch him."<br><br>Bran gave the pup a quick nervous stroke, then turned as Jon said, "Here you go." His half brother put a second pup into his arms. "There are five of them." Bran sat down in the snow and hugged the wolf pup to his face. Its fur was soft and warm against his cheek.<br><br>"Direwolves loose in the realm, after so many years," muttered Hullen, the master of horse. "I like it not."<br><br>"It is a sign," Jory said.<br><br>Father frowned. "This is only a dead animal, Jory," he said. Yet he seemed troubled. Snow crunched under his boots as he moved around the body. "Do we know what killed her?"<br><br>"There's something in the throat," Robb told him, proud to have found the answer before his father even asked. "There, just under the jaw."<br>His father knelt and groped under the beast's head with his hand. He gave a yank and held it up for all to see. A foot of shattered antler, tines snapped off, all wet with blood.<br><br>A sudden silence descended over the party. The men looked at the antler uneasily, and no one dared to speak. Even Bran could sense their fear, though he did not understand.<br><br>His father tossed the antler to the side and cleansed his hands in the snow. "I'm surprised she lived long enough to whelp," he said. His voice broke the spell.<br><br>"Maybe she didn't," Jory said. "I've heard tales . . . maybe the bitch was already dead when the pups came."<br><br>"Born with the dead," another man put in. "Worse luck."<br><br>"No matter," said Hullen. "They be dead soon enough too."<br><br>Bran gave a wordless cry of dismay.<br><br>"The sooner the better," Theon Greyjoy agreed. He drew his sword. <br><br>"Give the beast here, Bran."<br><br>The little thing squirmed against him, as if it heard and understood. <br><br><i>"No!"</i> Bran cried out fiercely. "It's mine."<br><br>"It be a mercy to kill them," Hullen said.<br><br>Bran looked to his lord father for rescue, but got only a frown, a furrowed brow. "Hullen speaks truly, son. Better a swift death than a hard one from cold and starvation."<br><br><i>"No!"</i> He could feel tears welling in his eyes, and he looked away. He did not want to cry in front of his father.<br><br>"Lord Stark," Jon said. It was strange to hear him call Father that, so formal. Bran looked at him with desperate hope. "There are five pups," he told Father. "Three male, two female."<br><br>"What of it, Jon?"<br><br>"You have five true born children," Jon said. "Three sons, two daughters. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. Your children were meant to have these pups, my lord."<br><br>Bran saw his father's face change, saw the other men exchange glances. He loved Jon with all his heart at that moment. Even at seven, Bran understood what his brother had done. The count had come right only because Jon had omitted himself. He had included the girls, included even Rickon, the baby, but not the bastard who bore the surname Snow, the name that custom decreed be given to all those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of their own.<br><br>Their father understood as well. "You want no pup for yourself, Jon?" he asked softly.<br><br>"The direwolf graces the banners of House Stark," Jon pointed out. "I am no Stark, Father."<br><br>Their lord father regarded Jon thoughtfully. Robb rushed into the silence he left. "I will nurse him myself, Father," he promised. "I will soak a towel with warm milk, and give him suck from that."<br><br>"Me too!" Bran echoed.<br><br>The lord weighed his sons long and carefully with his eyes. "Easy to say, and harder to do. I will not have you wasting the servants' time with this. If you want these pups, you will feed them yourselves. Is that understood?"<br><br>Bran nodded eagerly. The pup squirmed in his grasp, lickedat his face with a warm tongue.<br><br>It was not until they were mounted and on their way that Bran allowed himself to taste the sweet air of victory. By then, his pup was snuggled inside his leathers, warm against him, safe for the long ride home. Bran was wondering what to name him.<br><br>Halfway across the bridge, Jon pulled up suddenly.<br><br>"What is it, Jon?" their lord father asked.<br><br>"Can't you hear it?"<br><br>Bran could hear the wind in the trees, the clatter of their hooves on the ironwood planks, the whimpering of his hungry pup, but Jon was listening to something else.<br><br>"There," Jon said. He swung his horse around and galloped back across the bridge. They watched him dismount where the direwolf lay dead in the snow, watched him kneel. A moment later he was riding back to them, smiling.<br><br>"He must have crawled away from the others," Jon said.<br><br>"Or been driven away," their father said, looking at the sixth pup. His fur was white, where the rest of the litter was grey. His eyes were as red as the blood of the ragged man who had died that morning. Bran thought it curious that this pup alone would have opened his eyes while the others were still blind.<br><br>"An albino," Theon Greyjoy said with wry amusement. "This one will die even faster than the others."<br><br>Jon Snow gave his father's ward a long, chilling look. "I think not, Greyjoy," he said. "This one belongs to me."</p><h2>Frank Lloyd Wright</h2><p><p>A building by Frank Lloyd Wright (1867-1959) is at once unmistakably individual, and evocative of an entire era.

It is in these heart-hungry moments&#x2015;when we feel overwhelmed or alone, struggle with unanswered prayers, aren&#x2019;t sure what to do, or are crying out for God&#x2019;s help&#x2015;that we are surprisingly poised to pray the most effective kinds of prayers possible. <i>Extreme Prayer</i> taps into that longing for connection with God when we need it most by teaching us to pray the kinds of prayers Jesus promised to answer with unlimited power. It&#x2019;s not about how to pray <i>more</i> . . . it&#x2019;s about praying <i>differently</i>, and intentionally tapping into all of Jesus&#x2019;s open-ended promises in a way that achieves maximum Kingdom impact. In <i>Extreme Prayer</i>, Greg Pruett searches the Scriptures to discover the kinds of prayers that God has promised to answer, challenging you to access their power and see His immeasurable glory unleashed in your prayer life.</p><p></p><h2>Yona of the Dawn, Vol. 2 (2)</h2><p>A red-haired princess loses her family and her kingdom...

Young women are not exempt from this pressure. In fact, this is the time&#x2015;in our teens and twenties&#x2015;when we&#x2019;re just beginning to fall prey to the increasing stress of school, social media, smartphones, relationships, work, and busyness. We&#x2019;re barely out of childhood and already feeling overwhelmed, exhausted, depressed, drowned, and burned out. That&#x2019;s why we need the joyful refreshment of the gospel of grace. And that&#x2019;s exactly what Shona and David Murray deliver in <i>Refresh</i>. They write warmly, empathetically, biblically, and practically.

A hand met his there and gripped his wrist, hard. He swung over to kick at the vague shadow, but he was grasped at the ankles as well, and a bag was forced over his head, followed by a return to sleep that would have been gentle if part of him wasn't screaming to the rest that he wouldn't ever wake up.<br><br>He did wake again, however. The bag and the cloying scent of somniculous remained, but the drug itself was obviously dissipated. He was lying on a hard but inconstant surface, and he soon recognized by the motion that he was in a boat, on water. His hands and feet were efficiently bound. His captors did not speak, but he could hear their breathing and exertions at the oars. He couldn't make out anything through the sack except light, but he felt the sun on his skin and guessed it was approaching midday.<br><br>Not much later, there was a bit of jostling and then the shock of the boat coming on shore. He smelled pine.<br><br>They cut the bindings on his feet and made him walk. He kept thinking he ought to say something, but his kidnappers behaved so professionally he knew there wasn't much point. There was no talking them out of whatever they were doing with him. All he could do was wait, and wonder. Would he feel it? Would he know anything had happened?<br><br>Colin killed a man once. He died confused, begging, unwilling to admit even as the knife cut into him what was happening.<br><br>He wished he could have seen his mother again, and-realizing he was weeping-felt ashamed. He'd wanted to be braver.<br><br>The hand on his arm came away. He tried not to shake.<br><br>Then one of the men made a peculiar sound, a sigh like a very tired man finally lying down.<br><br>"What?" the other asked, before sucking a sharp breath.<br><br>Colin heard two distinct thumps-then for a moment, nothing. He wondered if he should run.<br><br>"Who do you work for?" a feminine voice asked.<br><br>He recognized it, and a deep chill wracked through him. The last time he'd heard that voice had been in a house in the Market District, just before its owner slaughtered at least eight men.<br><br>"Come," she said. "Tell me."<br><br>"I'm not at liberty to say," he replied.<br><br>"Keep still," she said. A moment later the sack came off his head.<br><br>And there she was, regarding him, Letine Arese. Her small frame, turned-up nose, and short blond hair made her seem almost like a little girl, but he knew her to be thirty-one years of age, and her blue eyes held a cold intensity that was quite un-childlike.<br><br>Those eyes narrowed now.<br><br>"You look familiar," she said. "I've seen you. I suppose that makes sense."<br><br>He glanced behind her, at the two bodies on the ground. Both were male; one was an Argonian, the other a Bosmer. They both seemed quite dead, although he could not see the cause.<br><br>"They brought you out here to kill you," she said.<br><br>"I gathered that," he replied. "I'm grateful you stopped them."<br><br>"Are you? We'll get back to that in a moment." She folded her hands behind her back. She was dressed in Bosmer woodsman style, with high boots and soft leather vest and breeches. It was an odd look for her, in his experience-he'd only ever seen her in relatively fashionable city attire.<br><br>"What would you say if I told you they worked for me?" she asked.<br><br>"I would be confused," Colin said carefully.<br><br>"Yes, I should hope so," she told him. "They noticed you spying on me and brought it to my attention. So of course, I did a little checking of my own. Colin Vineben, from Anvil. Your father is dead, and your mother does laundry. You were recommended for and received training for the Penitus Oculatus, and recently were named an inspector in that organization. It was you who discovered the massacre of Prince Attrebus's personal guard and the apparent murder of the prince, and you who suggested to the Emperor that the prince wasn't actually dead. Which, as it turns out, you were right about. And now you're spying on me, but without, it seems, any official authority to do so. So I wonder if you're employed by someone else."<br><br>"Why did you kill them?" he asked.<br><br>"Because otherwise, I would have had to kill you," she snapped. "Now I have to account for them, pretend I sent them on a mission to someplace fatal. Otherwise, the two of them would have wondered why you were still walking, and after a while that wonder would have spread its way up to the minister himself."<br><br>"I don't understand," Colin said.<br><br>"I'm risking my neck for you, you idiot," Arese snapped suddenly. "Can't you see that?"<br><br>"I can see it," he replied. "I just don't get why."<br><br>She pulled a knife from her belt and stalked toward him. His chest tightened, but she merely cut the ropes that held his hands behind his back. Then she stepped back a bit and untied her pants, loosening the laces and pulling one side down, exposing her hip.<br><br>"You know what that is?" she asked, indicating a small black tattoo of a wolf's head.<br><br>He did, of course. It was the Emperor's personal brand, worn only by his innermost circle.<br><br>He didn't say anything, but she saw he recognized it, and pulled the breeches back up, tying them again.<br><br>"He put me in the minister's office ten years ago," she said. "No one knows but him and me. And now you."<br><br>"Why are you telling me this?"<br><br>"Because I need help, and I think we may have a common purpose."<br><br>"What's that?"<br><br>"To discover why Minister Hierem wants Prince Attrebus dead."<br><br>"Does he?"<br><br>"I should know," she said. "I made the arrangements for the ambush on his orders."<br><br>"Why?" Colin exploded. "If you're loyal to the Emperor-"<br><br>She barked a laugh. "You knew," she said. "You were there, weren't you? When I took care of Calvur and his thugs. I knew someone was there!" She closed her eyes for a moment, looking very tired.<br><br>"I didn't mean for the prince to come to harm," she said. "If I could have gotten word to the Emperor, I would have. It was impossible at the time, at least without revealing myself to Hierem. In the end, a decision had to be made."<br><br>"And you decided you were more important than the prince?"<br><br>"Yes. If you knew anything about him, you would probably agree."<br><br>"And yet Hierem wants him dead."<br><br>"Apparently."<br><br>"Then why hasn't the Emperor had the minister arrested?"<br><br>"When the Emperor first placed me in the ministry, he didn't have any particular worries about Hierem, only the sort of general paranoia a successful monarch must have. For most of the past ten years, the minister has been above suspicion, but a year or so ago he began testing me, first subtly, then overtly. It became clear he wanted his own private intelligence and eliminations organization, one not connected to the Penitus Oculatus or known to the Emperor. The attack on Attrebus was-surprising. I didn't see that coming. It's only because some of the assassins got greedy that the prince survived. The Emperor isn't ready to move against Hierem yet because he doesn't believe we know everything, and because the minister is politically important-very important. The Emperor has survived because he waits until he knows where all the forces are and their strengths before he strikes. Right now, Hierem thinks his actions are invisible. We want to keep it that way a bit longer. That's where you come in, if you're up to it."<br><br>"Up to what?"<br><br>"Hierem trusts me now, completely I believe. But that limits me. And I can't trust anyone else in the ministry. I can open certain doors, but I need someone who can walk through them. Can you be that man?"<br><br>Colin considered for a moment. Arese might be telling the truth and she might be lying; in a way, it didn't matter. If he agreed to help her, it gave him a chance to find the answers he sought, even if she was steering him away from them. If he told her no, it was pretty certain he was staying on this island for eternity.<br><br>"I can be that man," he told her.<br><br>two<br><br>When he smelled blood, Mere-Glim turned in the deep waters of the Marrow Sump, trying to find the source. Blood wasn't an unusual smell in these waters; bodies were dumped here every day, many still feebly struggling against death. But this blood was not only fresh, it had a certain rotten scent he'd come to know all too well.<br><br>He closed his eyes and flared his reptilian nostrils, and when he identified the current that carried the smell, he struck out along it, his webbed hands and feet propelling him swiftly through the clear waters. It took him only a few moments before he could see the erratically twitching figure trying to reach the surface.<br><br>By the time he reached her, the life was dimming from her eyes. He wasn't sure if she ever actually saw him. Blood still roiled in clouds from her nostrils and gaping mouth. He reached around her from behind and kicked purposefully toward the surface, but by the time he reached it, she had gone limp.<br><br>He took her into the skraw caves along the shoreline anyway, and laid her out on the little bier his coworkers had made from woven cane and grass for the dead to rest on. In the sunlight she'd looked old, worn, with black bags beneath her eyes and hair like lank kelp, but here in the phosphorescence from the cave walls she appeared younger, more like the ten or fifteen years she probably actually was. On Umbriel, people were born as adults, and those born to be skraws, to tend and harvest the sump, had nothing that resembled a childhood.<br><br>He heard others approaching and looked over his shoulder to see his friend Wert and a young skraw named Oluth.<br><br>"Joacin," Wert sighed. "I knew she couldn't last much longer."<br><br>"I'm sorry," Glim told him. "I couldn't reach her in time."<br><br>"It wouldn't have mattered," Wert said. "If you had, she might have lived another day."<br><br>"A day is a day," Glim said.<br><br>Wert knelt and studied the woman's face for a long moment, his own visage more long and doleful than usual.<br><br>"When do we move forward?" he asked without looking up. "Isn't it time to take the next step?"<br><br>"We're done with the maps," Oluth blurted. He was young, probably no more than three years old; his skin had only the barest hint of the jaundice that plagued the older skraws.<br><br>"Good," Glim replied.<br><br>"So-like Wert said-what's next?" the hatchling went on eagerly.<br><br>"I'm still planning that," Glim told him.<br><br>"You excited everyone, Glim," Wert said. "You gave us all hope. But now-some say that you're stalling."<br><br>"We have to be prepared," Glim said. "We have to be careful. Once we start, there's no turning back. Does everyone understand that?"<br><br>"They do," Wert said. "They're ready to do what you say, Glim. But you have to say something."<br><br>Glim felt his heart sink. "Soon," he said.<br><br>"How soon?"<br><br>"I'll let you know."<br><br>Wert frowned, but nodded. Then he turned to Oluth.<br><br>"Go with Glim. He'll show you about the lower sump. You'll be working down there with him."<br><br>"It'll be an honor," Oluth said.<br><br>Glim waited for Oluth to go take the vapors and felt guilty. The caustic fumes allowed the skraws to breathe underwater, but they also killed them young, as they had just killed Joacin. Of all the skraws, he was the only one who hadn't been born on Umbriel, the only Argonian- the only one who didn't need the vapors to breathe beneath the surface.<br><br>When the youngster joined him in the shallows, Glim took him down below the midway of the cone-shaped body of water and showed him the cocooned figures fastened to the wall. Inside each was something that had started as a worm smaller than his least claw, but were now in various stages of becoming inhabitants of Umbriel. He brushed against one near term, a lanky female who-in appearance-would be human. Next to her grew a brick-red creature with horns, and farther along a man with the dusky skin of a Dunmer. All began as worms, however, and beneath appearances they were all Umbrielians. He tried not to be annoyed by Oluth's eagerness as he explained the procedures for tending the unborn and moving them to the birthing pools when their time came, and how to know that time. He could tell the boy was only half paying attention. He kept glancing around, especially down, to the bottom of the sump, where the actinic glare of the connexion with the ingenium lay.<br><br>"You're curious about that?" Glim asked.<br><br>"That's the ingenium," Oluth said. "That's the heart and soul of Umbriel. If we controlled that . . . "<br><br>"Even if we could do it," Glim said, "that would be too much."<br><br>"But if we're to really revolt, carry the fight to the lords-"</p><h2>All About Sam</h2><p>At last Sam, Anastasia Krupnik&#39;s irrepressible little brother, gets a chance to tell his own story. From his first days at the hospital, through his Terrible Twos, to his first days at nursery school, we see what Sam is really like. But things are never quite like they seem. In the delivery room, Sam&#39;s first words, &#34;Don&#39;t drop me,&#34; are heard only as &#34;Waaaaahhhh!&#34; And even though he has a perfectly logical explanation for flushing his sister&#39;s goldfish down the toilet, no one understands. From training pants to moving day to nursery school, Sam continually tries to unravel the mysteries of the world at large, facing each crisis and adventure head on and responding with his own brand of humor, candor, and naive insight.</p><p>Sam's big sister Anastasia (<i>Anastasia Krupnik</i>, <i>Anastasia at Your Service</i>) thinks he's, well, there's no other word for it, weird. Their parents say he's precocious. But Sam knows, even on the morning of his birth, when there are bright lights, and he's cold, and someone is messing around with his belly button, that he's just Sam. And as the younger brother of the original drama queen herself, Anastasia, Sam deserves a book all to himself. From those early moments at the hospital, to his first steps and words, to his lively days of nursery school, Sam escorts the reader through his mischief-filled life. His highly developed--and hilarious--verbal skills allow readers to get behind the fascinating logic of a toddler: Why won't it rain lipsticks and plastic pretzels if he flushes them down the toilet? And the King of Worms most certainly does deserve a prize at the pet show. Award-winning Lois Lowry has an uncanny ability to understand children of any age. Without ever patronizing, she manages to make their foibles wildly funny and unerringly true. (Ages 9 to 12) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i>Everyone knows Sam Krupnik. He's Anastasia's pesty but lovable younger brother.<p></p><p>This is Sam's big chance to tell things exactly the way he sees them.

The publication of Longfellow&#x2019;s classic Revolutionary War poem, &#x201c;Paul Revere&#x2019;s Ride,&#x201d; was less than a month hence, and the country&#x2019;s grave political unrest weighed heavily on his mind. Yet with his beloved wife, Fanny, and their five adored children at his side, the delights of the season prevailed.<br><br> In present-day Boston, a dedicated teacher in the Watertown public school system is stunned by somber holiday tidings.&nbsp;Sophia&#x2019;s&nbsp;music program has been sacrificed to budget cuts, and she worries not only about her&nbsp;impending unemployment but also about the consequences to her underprivileged students. At the church where she volunteers as music director, Sophia tries to forget her cares as she leads the children&#x2019;s choir in rehearsal for a Christmas Eve concert. Inspired to honor a local artist, Sophia has chosen a carol set to a poem by Longfellow, moved by the glorious words he penned one Christmas Day long ago, even as he suffered great loss.<br><br> <i>Christmas Bells</i>&nbsp;chronicles the events of 1863, when the peace and contentment of&nbsp;Longfellow&#x2019;s&nbsp;family circle was suddenly, tragically broken, cutting even deeper than the privations of wartime. Through the pain of profound loss and hardship, Longfellow&#x2019;s patriotism never failed, nor did the power of his language. &#x201c;Christmas Bells,&#x201d; the poem he wrote that holiday, lives on, spoken as verse and sung as a hymn.&nbsp;<br><br> Jennifer Chiaverini&#x2019;s resonant and heartfelt novel for the season reminds us why we must continue to hear glad tidings, even as we are tested by strife. Reading&nbsp;<i>Christmas Bells</i>&nbsp;evokes the resplendent joy of a chorus of voices raised in reverent song.</p><p><b>Jennifer Chiaverini</b> is the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author of <i>Enchantress of Numbers</i>,&nbsp;<i>Mrs. Lincoln's&nbsp;Dressmaker</i>,&nbsp;<i>Fates and Traitors</i>, and other acclaimed works of historical fiction, as&nbsp;well as the beloved Elm Creek Quilts series. She lives with her husband and two sons&nbsp;in Madison, Wisconsin.<p>CHAPTER ONE<br><br><i>The Music Teacher&#x2019;s Tale</i><br>Only the most jaded of critics would deny that the Winter Holiday Concert had been an artistic triumph, and as far as Sophia could tell as the audience filed from the auditorium to meet the young performers in the cafeteria for juice and cookies, no one fitting that description had attended. Granted, the fourth-grade recorders might have been a little shrill on &#x201c;Frosty the Snowman,&#x201d; and perhaps half of the second grade had mumbled all but the chorus of &#x201c;I Have a Little Dreidel,&#x201d; and Sophia should have known better than to assign a treble solo to a boy who had started the semester as a sweet-voiced cherub but now looked as if Santa might need to bring him a shaving kit for Christmas. But despite those few glitches, the children had performed beautifully. Certainly the rapturous smiles and the crash of applause that met their curtain calls proved that the audience had been well pleased.</p><p>With the assistance of the school custodian and a few helpful fifth-grade girls, Sophia soon had the costumes packed away, the cardboard sets dismantled, and the stage put in order, or at least as orderly as it could be, given the loose floorboards, the threadbare curtain, and the empty sockets they had insufficient lightbulbs to fill. Sophia knew they were lucky to have a theater at all, considering that decades of overcrowding had forced other local schools to convert performance spaces into classrooms. Sophia shared her music room with the art teacher, Yolanda, who served three different schools in the district and came to Peleg Wadsworth Elementary only twice a week. Yolanda had to haul most of her supplies from school to school, packing them into her fourteen-year-old compact car like pieces of a puzzle designed by Escher. Although she was by nature cheerfully optimistic, Yolanda looked perpetually harried and distracted as she pushed her overloaded plastic cart from parking lot to classroom and back, and she had developed a habit of constantly checking her watch and glancing at calendars to make sure she was at the right school on the right day. &#x201c;Artists must suffer,&#x201d; she joked whenever Sophia asked how she was doing. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never felt more artistic.&#x201d;</p><p>Sophia and her stage crew finished tidying up in time to join the reception in its final minutes. Empty bottles of apple juice filled the cafeteria&#x2019;s recycling bin, and only a few broken cookies remained of the plates of treats donated by the performers&#x2019; families. Sophia savored each delicious bite of the last gingerbread reindeer, modestly accepting praise and congratulations from parents, grandparents, and staff. As the crowd dwindled, Sophia returned to her classroom to pack up her things, gifts from her students, and projects to grade over the winter break. Her stomach growled; she could have used a second cookie and a strong cup of coffee. If she hurried, she might have time to grab something on the way from school to choir practice at St. Margaret&#x2019;s Catholic Church, where she volunteered as the children&#x2019;s music director.</p><p>She had just wrapped herself in a scarf and was slipping into her black wool coat when Linda, the principal&#x2019;s thin, gray-haired secretary, appeared in the classroom doorway. &#x201c;Oh, good, Sophia. I caught you.&#x201d; She peered over the rim of her bifocals at the overstuffed satchel on Sophia&#x2019;s desk, so full of little handmade gifts, cards, and carefully wrapped sweets that it could not close. &#x201c;Impressive. You brought in quite a haul this year.&#x201d;</p><p>Sophia smiled as she buttoned her coat. &#x201c;Yes, I should be fully stocked with fudge and peppermint through Epiphany.&#x201d;</p><p>Linda laughed, but her amusement swiftly faded. &#x201c;Janine would like to see you in her office before you leave.&#x201d;</p><p>Sophia felt a flutter of nerves. &#x201c;Did she say why?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You should talk to her.&#x201d; Linda edged out of the doorway looking pained. &#x201c;Have a nice winter break. Merry Christmas.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Merry Christmas,&#x201d; Sophia replied as Linda hurried away.</p><p>Sophia&#x2019;s certainty that something was amiss rose as she entered the administration offices and the dean of students wished her happy holidays in a voice usually reserved for offering condolences.</p><p>She found Janine standing behind her desk in her private office, frowning thoughtfully as she examined papers in a file. &#x201c;Sophia,&#x201d; she said, glancing up, warmly professional as she gestured to a chair on the opposite side. &#x201c;Thank you for coming. Please, have a seat.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It never gets easier,&#x201d; Sophia said lightly as she set her bag on the floor, loosened her scarf, and took her seat. &#x201c;Being called to the principal&#x2019;s office, I mean, whether you&#x2019;re a student or a teacher.&#x201d;</p><p>Janine Washington had been the principal of Peleg Wadsworth Elementary for eight years, and under her direction attendance had soared, test scores had risen, and suspensions had plummeted so low that the faculty dared hope they had become a thing of the past. Sophia had arrived on the scene three years into Janine&#x2019;s tenure, a student teacher full of idealism and grand plans to find a well-paying job with a prestigious music program in an affluent district as soon as she graduated. Instead, she had fallen in love with the children of Watertown and with Janine&#x2019;s vision of how to give them the excellent education they deserved, the kind their more fortunate peers in Beacon Hill and the Back Bay took for granted.</p><p>&#x201c;The concert was excellent,&#x201d; Janine said. &#x201c;I think it was the children&#x2019;s best yet&#x2014;and yours. Congratulations.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d; Spiritedly, Sophia added, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m very proud of the students. Each and every one of them did their very best.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I agree. That makes what I have to tell you all the more difficult.&#x201d; Janine regarded her sympathetically. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re aware, I&#x2019;m sure, that the measure to raise the tax levy to increase the education budget failed to pass in last month&#x2019;s election.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d; For weeks, every conversation in the teachers&#x2019; lounge had circled back to the ballot measure. In the days leading up to the election, Sophia had passed out leaflets encouraging citizens to vote yes, and, lacking a car, she had placed a bumper sticker in the window of her apartment. It was still there, a memorial to the failed measure, a reprimand to those who had supported the cause but had neglected to go to the polls, and a promise to herself to fight harder next time. &#x201c;But the district will draw on emergency funds to make up the difference, right? I read that there&#x2019;s enough for the rest of this academic year and the next. By that time the measure will be on the ballot again.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid those estimates were overly optimistic,&#x201d; said Janine. &#x201c;They didn&#x2019;t take into account the mold problem at the high school, or the dip in interest rates. The district&#x2019;s reserves have been dealt quite a blow. I&#x2019;ve been informed that at their next meeting, the school board plans to introduce new austerity measures.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Austerity measures?&#x201d; Sophia echoed. &#x201c;You mean budget cuts.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Emergency budget cuts.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I see.&#x201d; Sophia sat back in her chair, dismayed. It was no secret which programs were the first to be sacrificed in an emergency. &#x201c;Janine, children need music in their lives. Most of our students aren&#x2019;t likely to get any arts education if they don&#x2019;t get it here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I understand that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s been proven scientifically that music lessons help children&#x2019;s brain development and result in higher test scores, especially in math, and significantly fewer discipline problems. Students without education in the arts are five times more likely to drop out of school. Five times!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d; Janine raised a hand to calm her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve read the reports. I&#x2019;ve helped write many of them. However, when deciding whether to fund fifth-grade chorus or keep the furnaces going, most people, including those in charge of our budget, see only one logical choice.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What does this mean for me?&#x201d; Sophia asked, fighting to keep her voice from quavering. &#x201c;Will I have to travel from school to school like Yolanda, spending a few days here and a few days there?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Someone will,&#x201d; said Janine gently. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m afraid that won&#x2019;t be you. The two other music teachers in the district have seniority. They&#x2019;ll drop to half time and share the single position that will remain. Sophia, I&#x2019;m afraid you&#x2019;re going to be laid off.&#x201d;</p><p>Sophia stared at her, scarcely able to breathe. &#x201c;Going to be?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. At the end of the school year.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, thank God. I thought you meant I was done, finished, today, without having the chance to say goodbye to anyone&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course not. That would be a shameful way to repay you for the five years of exemplary service you&#x2019;ve offered our school.&#x201d;</p><p>Sophia forced a wan smile. &#x201c;Would you be willing to put that in a letter of recommendation?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Certainly. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m telling you now, even at the risk of losing you halfway through next semester, to give you time to find another position.&#x201d; Janine leaned forward and folded her arms on her desk, her expression full of regret and compassion. &#x201c;I know you were considering a move to Chicago, and that you had several promising leads there. Perhaps it&#x2019;s time to follow up on them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s . . . not really an option. I&#x2019;m not moving to Chicago.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I thought your fianc� had accepted a job there. I hear things in passing through the teachers&#x2019; lounge, but perhaps I misunderstood.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Brandon did take that job in Chicago, but he&#x2019;s not my fianc� anymore.&#x201d; Not since October, when Sophia realized that she couldn&#x2019;t bear to leave her family&#x2014;and her job and her students and her choir at St. Margaret&#x2019;s&#x2014;to follow him. She <i>could</i> have, but she didn&#x2019;t <i>want</i> to&#x2014;which forced her to admit that marrying Brandon would be a mistake even if he weren&#x2019;t moving away.</p><p>&#x201c;I see,&#x201d; said Janine. &#x201c;My apologies. I wasn&#x2019;t aware.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not your fault. I announced the engagement, but not the end of it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I still regret bringing up an unhappy subject and making a difficult conversation even worse.&#x201d; Janine rose and came around her desk to rest her hand on Sophia&#x2019;s shoulder, a motherly gesture that brought tears to Sophia&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;We can talk more after winter break. I&#x2019;ll see you in January.&#x201d;</p><p>Sophia stammered out a perfunctory reply and hurried from the office, keeping her head down as she left the school rather than be drawn into a conversation with any concerned coworkers she might encounter along the way. Outside, a capricious wind drove a burst of snow crystals into her face, startling her so that she gasped, but when the shock faded, she settled into an unexpected sense of calm. She had lost her job, but Janine had given her six months&#x2019; notice.

By the end of her first year as a voice major at Boston College, after many inspiring and humbling months learning and performing with other eager young students&#x2014;all of whom, like her, had been the best singer in their high school choirs and had won every lead in drama club&#x2014;she began to realize that she was talented, but perhaps not talented enough.

He had encouraged her to continue to study music, since it was her passion, but also to expand her repertoire to teaching, the better to share that passion with others.</p><p>It proved to be excellent advice. Sophia had not long been a teacher when she realized that she was privileged and blessed to be able to pursue that calling, and now she could not imagine a more enriching or meaningful career.

The angels in this drama are not the beautiful, godly, kind beings of lore, but instead are deadly, heartless creatures who experiment on humans and wish to eradicate them from the Earth. The story continues with Penryn struggling to keep her schizophrenic mother and recovering test subject sister, Paige, together. Things are beginning to look up until an angry mob abducts Paige because of her grotesque physique. Penryn and her mother make it their goal to find their ghastly family member, but they fall into a trap set by the angels. As the story unfolds, listeners will learn the fate of Raffe and the other angels who have made Earth a living nightmare with their hybrid scorpion creations.

Kaplan, the bestselling author of <i>Monsoon</i> and <i>Balkan Ghosts,</i> offers a revelatory new prism through which to view global upheavals and to understand what lies ahead for continents and countries around the world.</b><br><br>Bestselling author Robert D. Kaplan builds on the insights, discoveries, and theories of great geographers and geopolitical thinkers of the recent and distant past to look back at critical pivots in history and then to look forward at the evolving global scene. Kaplan traces the history of the world&#x2019;s hot spots by examining their climates, topographies, and proximities to other embattled lands. He then applies the lessons learned to the present crises in Europe, Russia, China, the Indian Subcontinent, Turkey, Iran, and the Arab Middle East. The result is a holistic interpretation of the next cycle of conflict throughout Eurasia, a visionary glimpse into a future that can be understood only in the context of temperature, land allotment, and other physical certainties. A brilliant rebuttal to thinkers who suggest that globalism will trump geography, this indispensable work shows how timeless truths and natural facts can help prevent this century&#x2019;s looming cataclysms.<br><b><br>Praise for <i>The Revenge of Geography</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[An] ambitious and challenging new book . . .

Of course, such a loss is gradual. But the moment I have isolated, when that loss seemed most acute, was immediately after the collapse of the Berlin Wall. Though an artificial border whose crumbling should have enhanced our respect for geography and the relief map&#x2014;�and what that map might have foreshadowed in the adjacent Balkans and the Middle East&#x2014;�the Berlin Wall&#x2019;s erasure made us blind to the real geographical impediments that still divided us, and still awaited us.<br><br>For suddenly we were in a world in which the dismantling of a man-�made boundary in Germany had led to the assumption that all human divisions were surmountable; that democracy would conquer Africa and the Middle East as easily as it had Eastern Europe; that globalization&#x2014;�soon to become a buzzword&#x2014;�was nothing less than a moral direction of history and a system of international security, rather than what it actually was, merely an economic and cultural stage of development. Consider: a totalitarian ideology had just been vanquished, even as domestic security in the United States and Western Europe was being taken for granted. The semblance of peace reigned generally. Presciently capturing the zeitgeist, a former deputy director of the U.S. State Department&#x2019;s Policy Planning Staff, Francis Fukuyama, published an article a few months before the fall of the Berlin Wall, &#x201c;The End of History,&#x201d; proclaiming that while wars and rebellions would continue, history in a Hegelian sense was over now, since the success of capitalist liberal democracies had ended the argument over which system of government was best for humankind.1 Thus, it was just a matter of shaping the world more in our own image, sometimes through the deployment of American troops; deployments that in the 1990s would exact relatively little penalty. This, the first intellectual cycle of the Post Cold War, was an era of illusions. It was a time when the words &#x201c;realist&#x201d; and &#x201c;pragmatist&#x201d; were considered pejoratives, signifying an aversion to humanitarian intervention in places where the national interest, as conventionally and narrowly defined, seemed elusive. Better in those days to be a neoconservative or liberal internationalist, who were thought of as good, smart people who simply wanted to stop genocide in the Balkans.<br><br>Such a burst of idealism in the United States was not unprecedented. Victory in World War I had unfurled the banner of &#x201c;Wilsonianism,&#x201d; a notion associated with President Woodrow Wilson that, as it would turn out, took little account of the real goals of America&#x2019;s European allies and even less account of the realities of the Balkans and the Near East, where, as events in the 1920s would show, democracy and freedom from the imperial overlordship of the Ottoman Turks meant mainly heightened ethnic awareness of a narrow sort in the individual parts of the old sultanate. It was a similar phenomenon that followed the West&#x2019;s victory in the Cold War, which many believed would simply bring freedom and prosperity under the banners of &#x201c;democracy&#x201d; and &#x201c;free markets.&#x201d; Many suggested that even Africa, the poorest and least stable continent, further burdened with the world&#x2019;s most artificial and illogical borders, might also be on the brink of a democratic revolution; as if the collapse of the Soviet Empire in the heart of Europe held supreme meaning for the world&#x2019;s least developed nations, separated by sea and desert thousands of miles away, but connected by television.2 Yet, just as after World War I and World War II, our victory in the Cold War would usher in less democracy and global peace than the next struggle for survival, in which evil would wear new masks.<br><br>Democracy and better government would, in fact, begin to emerge in Africa of all places. But it would be a long and difficult struggle, with anarchy (in the cases of several West African countries), insurrection, and outright wickedness (in the case of Rwanda) rearing their heads for considerable periods in between. Africa would go a long way toward defining the long decade between November 9, 1989, and September 11, 2001&#x2014;�between the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the al Qaeda attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center: a twelve-�year period that saw mass murder and belated humanitarian interventions frustrate idealist intellectuals, even as the ultimate success of those interventions raised idealist triumphalism to heights that were to prove catastrophic in the decade that began after 9/11.<br><br>In that new decade following 9/11, geography, a factor certainly in the Balkans and Africa in the 1990s, would go on to wreak unmitigated havoc on America&#x2019;s good intentions in the Near East. The journey from Bosnia to Baghdad, from a limited air and land campaign in the western, most developed part of the former Turkish Empire in the Balkans to a mass infantry invasion in the eastern, least developed part in Mesopotamia, would expose the limits of liberal universalism, and in the process concede new respect to the relief map.<br><br>The Post Cold War actually began in the 1980s, before the collapse of the Berlin Wall, with the revival of the term &#x201c;Central Europe,&#x201d; later defined by the journalist and Oxford scholar Timothy Garton Ash as &#x201c;a political-�cultural distinction against the Soviet &#x2018;East.&#x2019; &#x201d;3 Central Europe, Mitteleuropa, was more of an idea than a fact of geography. It constituted a declaration of memory: that of an intense, deliciously cluttered, and romantic European civilization, suggestive of cobblestone streets and gabled roofs, of rich wine, Viennese caf�s, and classical music, of a gentle, humanist tradition infused with edgy and disturbing modernist art and thought. It conjured up the Austro-�Hungarian Empire and such names as Gustav Mahler, Gustav Klimt, and Sigmund Freud, leavened with a deep appreciation of the likes of Immanuel Kant and the Dutch-�Jewish philosopher Baruch Spinoza. Indeed, &#x201c;Central Europe,&#x201d; among so many other things, meant the endangered intellectual world of Jewry before the ravages of Nazism and communism; it meant economic development, with a sturdy recall of Bohemia, prior to World War II, as having enjoyed a higher level of industrialization than Belgium. It meant, with all of its decadence and moral imperfections, a zone of relative multiethnic tolerance under the umbrella of a benign if increasingly dysfunctional Habsburg Empire. In the last phase of the Cold War, Central Europe was succinctly captured by Princeton professor Carl E. Schorske in his troubling, icy-�eyed classic Fin-�de-�Si�cle Vienna: Politics and Culture, and by the Italian writer Claudio Magris in his sumptuous travelogue Danube. For Magris, Mitteleuropa is a sensibility that &#x201c;means the defence of the particular against any totalitarian programme.&#x201d; For the Hungarian writer Gy�rgy Konr�d and the Czech writer Milan Kundera, Mitteleuropa is something &#x201c;noble,&#x201d; a &#x201c;master-�key&#x201d; for liberalizing political aspirations.4<br><br>To speak of &#x201c;Central Europe&#x201d; in the 1980s and 1990s was to say that a culture in and of itself comprised a geography every bit as much as a mountain range did, or every bit as much as Soviet tanks did. For the idea of Central Europe was a rebuke to the geography of the Cold War, which had thrown up the term &#x201c;Eastern Europe&#x201d; to denote the half of Europe that was communist and controlled from Moscow. East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Hungary had all been part of Central Europe, it was rightly argued, and therefore should not have been consigned to the prison of nations that was communism and the Warsaw Pact. A few years later, ironically, when ethnic war broke out in Yugoslavia, &#x201c;Central Europe,&#x201d; rather than a term of unification, would also become one of division; with &#x201c;the Balkans&#x201d; dismembered in people&#x2019;s minds from Central Europe, and becoming, in effect, part of the new/old Near East.<br><br>The Balkans were synonymous with the old Turkish and Byzantine empires, with unruly mountain ranges that had hindered development, and with a generally lower standard of living going back decades and centuries compared to the lands of the former Habsburg and Prussian empires in the heart of Europe. During the monochrome decades of communist domination, Balkan countries such as Romania and Bulgaria did, in fact, suffer a degree of poverty and repression unknown to the northern, &#x201c;Central European&#x201d; half of the Soviet Empire. The situation was complicated, of course. East Germany was the most truly occupied of the satellite states, and consequently its communist system was among the most rigid, even as Yugoslavia&#x2014;�not formally a member of the Warsaw Pact&#x2014;�allowed a degree of freedom, particularly in its cities, that was unknown in Czechoslovakia, for example. And yet, overall, the nations of former Turkish and Byzantine southeastern Europe suffered in their communist regimes nothing less than a version of oriental despotism, as though a second Mongol invasion, whereas those nations of former Catholic Habsburg Europe mainly suffered something less malignant: a dreary mix in varying degrees of radical socialist populism. In this regard traveling from relatively liberal, albeit communist, Hungary under J�nos K�d�r to Romania under the totalitarianism of Nicolae Ceau&#x2db;sescu was typical in this regard. I made the trip often in the 1980s: as my train passed into Romania from Hungary, the quality of the building materials suddenly worsened; officials ravaged my luggage and made me pay a bribe for my typewriter; the toilet paper in the lavatory disappeared and lights went dim. True, the Balkans were deeply influenced by Central Europe, but they were just as influenced by the equally proximate Middle East. The dusty steppe with its bleak public spaces&#x2014;�imports both from Anatolia&#x2014;�were a feature of life in Kosovo and Macedonia, where the cultured conviviality of Prague and Budapest was harder to find. Thus, it was not altogether an accident, or completely the work of evil individuals, that violence broke out in the ethnic m�lange of Yugoslavia rather than, say, in the uniethnic Central European states of Hungary and Poland. History and geography also had something to do with it.<br><br>Yet by holding up Central Europe as a moral and political cynosure, rather than as a geographical one, liberal intellectuals like Garton Ash&#x2014;�one of the most eloquent voices of the decade&#x2014;�propounded a vision not only of Europe, but of the world that was inclusive rather than discriminatory. In this view, not only should the Balkans not be consigned to underdevelopment and barbarism, but neither should any place: Africa, for example. The fall of the Berlin Wall should affect not only Germany, but, rather, should unleash the dream of Central Europe writ large across the globe. This humanist approach was the essence of a cosmopolitanism that liberal internationalists and neoconservatives both subscribed to in the 1990s. Recall that before he became known for his support of the Iraq War, Paul Wolfowitz was a proponent of military intervention in Bosnia and Kosovo, in effect, joining hands with liberals like Garton Ash at the left-�leaning New York Review of Books. The road to Baghdad had roots in the Balkan interventions of the 1990s, which were opposed by realists and pragmatists, even as these military deployments in the former Yugoslavia were to prove undeniably successful.<br><br>The yearning to save the Muslims of Bosnia and Kosovo cannot be divorced from the yearning for the restoration of Central Europe, both as a real and poignantly imagined place, that would demonstrate how, ultimately, it is morality and humanism that sanctify beauty. (Though Garton Ash himself was skeptical of the effort to idealize Central Europe, he did see the positive moral use to which such an idealization might be applied.)<br><br>The humanist writings of Isaiah Berlin captured the intellectual spirit of the 1990s. &#x201c; &#x2018;Ich bin ein Berliner,&#x2019; I used to say, meaning an Isaiah Berliner,&#x201d; Garton Ash wrote in a haunting memoir of his time in East Germany.5 Now that communism had been routed and Marxist utopias exposed as false, Isaiah Berlin was the perfect antidote to the trendy monistic theories that had ravished academic life for the previous four decades. Berlin, who taught at Oxford and whose life was coeval with the twentieth century, had always defended bourgeois pragmatism and &#x201c;temporizing compromises&#x201d; over political experimentation.6 He loathed geographical, cultural, and all other forms of determinism, refusing to consign anyone and anybody to their fate. His views, articulated in articles and lectures over a lifetime, often as a lone academic voice in the wilderness, comprised the perfect synthesis of a measured idealism that was employed both against communism and the notion that freedom and security were only for some peoples and not for others. His philosophy and the ideal of Central Europe were perfect fits.<br><br>But though Central Europe writ large, as expounded by these wise and eloquent intellectuals, was indeed a noble cause, one which should perennially play a role in the foreign policies of all Western nations as I will demonstrate, it does face a hurdle with which I am also forced to deal.<br><br>For there remains a problem with this exalted vision, an ugly fact that throughout history has often turned the concept of Central Europe into something tragic. Central Europe simply has no reality on the relief map. (Garton Ash intuited this with the title of his own article, &#x201c;Does Central Europe Exist?&#x201d;)7 Enter the geographical determinists, so harsh and lowering compared to the gentle voice of Isaiah Berlin: particularly the Edwardian era voice of Sir Halford J. Mackinder and his disciple James Fairgrieve, for whom the idea of Central Europe has a &#x201c;fatal geographical flaw.&#x201d; Central Europe, Mackinder and Fairgrieve tell us, belongs to the &#x201c;crush zone&#x201d; that lays athwart Maritime Europe, with its &#x201c;oceanic interests,&#x201d; and the &#x201c;Eurasian Heartland with its continental outlook.&#x201d; In short, strategically speaking, there is &#x201c;no space&#x201d; for Central Europe in the view of Mackinder and Fairgrieve.8 The celebration of Central Europe, the justifiable indulgence of it by the liberal intellectuals, the writings of Mackinder and Fairgrieve suggest, indicates a respite from geopolitics&#x2014;�or at least the desire for one. Yet the fall of the Berlin Wall did not&#x2014;�could not&#x2014;�end geopolitics, but merely brought it into a new phase. You cannot simply wish away the struggle of states and empires across the map.<br><br>I will explore Mackinder&#x2019;s work, particularly his &#x201c;Heartland&#x201d; thesis, later at great length. Suffice it to say now that, expounded well over a hundred years ago, it proved remarkably relevant to the dynamics of World War I, World War II, and the Cold War. Stripped down to their most austere logic, the two world wars were about whether or not Germany would dominate the Heartland of Eurasia that lay to its east, while the Cold War centered on the Soviet Union&#x2019;s domination of Eastern Europe&#x2014;�the western edge of Mac�kinder&#x2019;s Heartland. This Soviet Eastern Europe, by the way, included in its domain East Germany, historic Prussia that is, which had traditionally been territorially motivated with an eastward, Heartland orientation; while inside NATO&#x2019;s oceanic alliance was West Germany, historically Catholic, and industrially and commercially minded, oriented toward the North Sea and the Atlantic. A renowned American geographer of the Cold War period, Saul B. Cohen, argues that &#x201c;the boundary zone that divides the East from West Germany . . . is one of the oldest in history,&#x201d; the one which separated Frankish and S...</p><h2>The Nix</h2><p><b><b><i>A&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i></i>2016 Notable Book<br><i>Entertainment Weekly's&nbsp;</i>#1 Book of the Year<br>A&nbsp;<i>Washington Post&nbsp;</i>2016 Notable Book<br>A&nbsp;<i>Slate&nbsp;</i>Top Ten Book</b><br><br><i>&#x201c;</i>Nathan Hill is a maestro.&#x201d; &#x2014;John Irving&nbsp;<br></b><br>It&#x2019;s 2011, and Samuel Andresen-Anderson hasn&#x2019;t seen his mother, Faye, in decades&#x2014;not since she abandoned the family when he was a boy. Now she&#x2019;s reappeared, having committed an absurd crime that electrifies the nightly news and inflames a politically divided country. The media paints Faye as a&nbsp;radical hippie with a sordid past, but as far as Samuel knows, his mother was an ordinary girl who married her high-school sweetheart. Which version of his mother is true? Two facts are certain: she&#x2019;s facing some serious charges, and she needs Samuel&#x2019;s help.<br><br>To save her, Samuel will have to embark on his own journey, uncovering long-buried secrets about the woman he thought he knew, secrets that stretch across generations and have their origin all the way back in Norway, home of the mysterious Nix.

At its center is Samuel Andresen-Anderson, a failed writer and increasingly apathetic college professor, who gets a second chance at literary fame from the most unlikely source&#x2014;the mother who abandoned him as a child. The American public is up in arms about a rather absurd crime that Samuel&#x2019;s mother committed against an obnoxious politician. While Sam is shocked and surprised to learn the whereabouts of his estranged mother, he also realizes it&#x2019;s the chance of a lifetime to tap into the zeitgeist with some choice tidbits about her, if he can write it before media A.D.D. sets in. But in order to write the book that will revive him, Samuel is forced to dig into her life, and he discovers a completely different version of the woman he thought he knew; it turns out he&#x2019;s not the only one who&#x2019;s life is carved out of traumatic events. Nathan Hill is incredibly perceptive, as in this, which I can&#x2019;t stop thinking about: &#x201c;The things we love the most are the most disfiguring.

He found that his predecessors on the Court were complicit in the first step of this transformation, when in the 1870s they defanged the Civil War amendments intended to give full citizenship to his fellow black Americans. In the next generation, Woodrow Wilson, dismissing the framers and their work as obsolete, set out to replace laws made by the people&#x2019;s representatives with rules made by highly educated, modern, supposedly nonpartisan &#x201c;experts,&#x201d; an idea Franklin Roosevelt supersized in the New Deal agencies that he acknowledged had no constitutional warrant. Then, under Chief Justice Earl Warren in the 1950s and 1960s, the Nine set about realizing Wilson&#x2019;s dream of a Supreme Court sitting as a permanent constitutional convention, conjuring up laws out of smoke and mirrors and justifying them as expressions of the spirit of the age. <br><br> But Thomas, who joined the Court after eight years running one of the myriad administrative agencies that the Great Society had piled on top of FDR&#x2019;s batch, had deep misgivings about the new governmental order. He shared the framers&#x2019; vision of free, self-governing citizens forging their own fate. And from his own experience growing up in segregated Savannah, flirting with and rejecting black radicalism at college, and running an agency that supposedly advanced equality, he doubted that unelected experts and justices really did understand the moral arc of the universe better than the people themselves, or that the rules and rulings they issued made lives better rather than worse. So in the hundreds of opinions he has written in more than a quarter century on the Court&#x2015;the most important of them explained in these pages in clear, non-lawyerly language&#x2015;he has questioned the constitutional underpinnings of the new order and tried to restore the limited, self-governing original one, as more legitimate, more just, and more free than the one that grew up in its stead. The Court now seems set to move down the trail he blazed. <br><br> A free, self-governing nation needs independent-minded, self-reliant citizens, and Thomas&#x2019;s biography, vividly recounted here, produced just the kind of character that the founders assumed would always mark Americans. America&#x2019;s future depends on the power of its culture and institutions to form ever more citizens of this stamp.</p><p>Myron Magnet, author of <i>The Founders at Home: The Building of America, 1735&#x2013;1817</i>, was the editor of the Manhattan Institute&#x2019;s <i>City Journal</i> and is now its editor-at-large.

Written for the&nbsp;lay reader,&nbsp;this brief volume makes a compelling case for originalism.

Do you wish your parents had been more nurturing and supportive? Are you wondering if you&#x2019;ll ever find your perfect soul mate and dream boss? Do you wish you had &#x201c;perfect&#x201d; children, relatives who never fight, and friends who always agree with you? No one gets to sail through life free of turbulence. What separates people who shake it off, bounce back, and stay positive from the bitter, never satisfied, and defeated? Best-selling author and former compulsive controller Daniel A. Miller convincingly attests that the answer is choosing acceptance. In the GIFTS OF ACCEPTANCE: Embracing People and Things as They Are, Danny shares what he&#x2019;s learned&#x2014;through extensive research, inspiring true stories, and his own experience with hardships&#x2014;about the integral relationship between accepting the facts of life and others, with their quirks, flaws, and differences, and enjoying greater satisfaction in life. Recognizing the benefits of acceptance isn&#x2019;t difficult.

He graduated from UCLA with honors in business administration and finished in the top 5 percent of his class at the UCLA School of Law.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>While still in his twenties, he became a popular real estate instructor in the UCLA extension program, and in his thirties he wrote a critically acclaimed, best-selling professional book,&nbsp;<i>How to Invest in Real Estate Syndicates&nbsp;</i>(DowJones-Irwin, 1978).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Financial success came early to Danny. Celebrities and other wealthy people entrusted him withlarge sums to invest on their behalf. By his midthirties he could afford to live in the exclusive Old Bel Air section of Los Angeles.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But for all his achievements and success, Danny had no sense of inner peace and serenity. He was imprisoned by his fears, anger, and anxieties--all bedfellows of controllers--and thus not open to the joy and wonders all around him.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>After suffering aseries of traumatic events and financial setbacks that he could not control--no matter how hard he tried--he finally began a new life journey based on letting go of control and accepting people and things as they are. He surrendered to the ups and downs and twists and turns of life instead of resisting them and trying to control people and events.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;In the process, he became an artist, a published poet, a successful businessman, a champion senior tennis player, a happily married man, and a much wiser parent.<br>&nbsp;<br>Thus, through letting go of control and embracing life as it is, Danny found a different and more gratifying kind of success--an internal, core sense of well-being. He now writes and speaks about the profound benefits of letting go of control and practicing acceptance. His website&nbsp;danielamiller.com&nbsp;features over seventy of his blog posts on the control and acceptance dynamics, his poetry and paintings, and keynote speaker information.&nbsp;"Verdict: A solid reminder to enjoy the life we've been given.

Buffalo Valley is dying. But its citizens won't give up on the town where generations have lived, loved, raised families, worked hard, and died. When Savannah-born Lindsay Snyder decides to accept the teaching position in Buffalo Valley, she brings a breath of fresh air with her. Lindsay is trying to escape a stalled romance and learn more about her family, especially her grandmother Gina, who lived her entire life in the tiny town. Buffalo Valley has its share of characters, including Hassie Knight, the matriarch of this small community; Buffalo Bob Carr, the ex-biker who won the local watering hole in a poker game; and Gage Sinclair, the handsome farmer whose roots are deeply planted in the fertile soil of this North Dakota village. But Gage refuses to believe that Lindsay will find any reason to stay so far from the bright lights of the big city she recently called home. And Lindsay despairs that Gage will never comprehend that she has the best reason to remain--love, for him. With its many story lines, <i>Dakota Born</i> is more novel than romance, but Macomber's loyal enthusiasts and those new to Macomber's magic touch will be rooting for the little town that won't say die. <i>--Alison Trinkle</i></p>Debbie Macomber is a #1 New York Times bestselling author and a leading voice in women&#x2019;s fiction worldwide.

(Backyard Books)</h2><p><p>Backyard Books: Are You an Ant? by Judy Allen with illustrations by Tudor Humphries will give children who love to track ants an inside look at the everyday life of this fascinating insect, as they explore the similarities and differences to themselves.</p></p><p><p>Author Judy Allen and illustrator Tudor Humphries created Kingfisher's award-winning Backyard Books series and many other successful books, including the Reading Rainbow selections Tiger and Seal. Tudor Humphries' recent titles include Hiding and A Floating World. Judy Allen is an award-winning author whose novel Awaiting Developments was short-listed for the Whitbread Children's Novel Award. Judy Allen and illustrator Tudor Humphries created Kingfisher's award-winning Backyard Books series and many other successful books, including the Reading Rainbow selections Tiger and Seal.</p>PreSchool-Grade 3-Easy-readers that offer a virtual bug's-eye view of the world. Vivid watercolor paintings on two-page spreads depict the subject insect in its backyard habitat; most views are close-ups, with the creature juxtaposed against towering leaves of grass, weeds, flowers, etc. (Several illustrations in Ant show the worker in its underground nest.) Short sentences in large, bold type are set against a white background. The lines of text are fluid, often broken up and framed by foliage, or sometimes wings of birds and body parts of other small animals. Each book begins by asking the title question, and then addresses readers directly, outlining the insect's daily experiences (e.g., "Work hard to build a nest.-It's all right; you don't have to work alone"). The books briefly describe hatching, growth and development, outstanding physical and behavioral characteristics, diet, defense mechanisms, and natural enemies, and conclude with a reality check: "However, if your mother and father look like this-you are not a-.You are-a human child." An addendum offers miscellaneous facts. Although the texts are clearly written and well organized, not all of the terms are defined, such as "aphid," "acid," and "poison" in Ant. Still, these attractive titles will be good companion volumes for Steve Parker's It's an Ant's Life (Reader's Digest, 1999) and Amanda Harman's Grasshoppers (Grolier, 2001), both of which are more detailed and aimed at a somewhat higher reading level.<br><i>Karey Wehner, formerly at San Francisco Public Library </i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Where Chefs Eat: A Guide to Chefs&#39; Favorite Restaurants</h2><p><p><b>Eat around the world with 650 of the world's best chefs.

With his acclaimed wit and acuity, Thomas Frank answers the riddle by examining his home state, Kansas-a place once famous for its radicalism that now ranks among the nation's most eager participants in the culture wars. Charting what he calls the "thirty-year backlash"-the popular revolt against a supposedly liberal establishment-Frank reveals how conservatism, once a marker of class privilege, became the creed of millions of ordinary Americans.</p><p>A brilliant analysis-and funny to boot-<i>What's the Matter with Kansas?</i> is a vivid portrait of an upside-down world where blue-collar patriots recite the Pledge while they strangle their life chances; where small farmers cast their votes for a Wall Street order that will eventually push them off their land; and where a group of frat boys, lawyers, and CEOs has managed to convince the country that it speaks on behalf of the People.</p></p><p>The largely blue collar citizens of Kansas can be counted upon to be a "red" state in any election, voting solidly Republican and possessing a deep animosity toward the left. This, according to author Thomas Frank, is a pretty self-defeating phenomenon, given that the policies of the Republican Party benefit the wealthy and powerful at the great expense of the average worker. According to Frank, the conservative establishment has tricked Kansans, playing up the emotional touchstones of conservatism and perpetuating a sense of a vast liberal empire out to crush traditional values while barely ever discussing the Republicans' actual economic policies and what they mean to the working class. Thus the pro-life Kansas factory worker who listens to Rush Limbaugh will repeatedly vote for the party that is less likely to protect his safety, less likely to protect his job, and less likely to benefit him economically. To much of America, Kansas is an abstract, "where Dorothy wants to return. Where Superman grew up." But Frank, a native Kansan, separates reality from myth in <i>What's the Matter with Kansas</i> and tells the state's socio-political history from its early days as a hotbed of leftist activism to a state so entrenched in conservatism that the only political division remaining is between the moderate and more-extreme right wings of the same party. Frank, the founding editor of <i>The Baffler</i> and a contributor to <i>Harper's</i> and <i>The Nation</i>, knows the state and its people. He even includes his own history as a young conservative idealist turned disenchanted college Republican, and his first-hand experience, combined with a sharp wit and thorough reasoning, makes his book more credible than the elites of either the left and right who claim to understand Kansas. <i>--John Moe</i><p><b>Thomas Frank</b> is the author of <i>Pity the Billionaire</i>, <i>The Wrecking Crew</i>, <i>What's the Matter with Kansas?</i>, and <i>One Market Under God</i>.

Grouped several per page and more or less chronologically within seven color-coded categories such as "space," "communication," and "at home," entries each include a color photo or historical image; name, date, and country of origin (where known); and a brief description. Along with occasional side boxes and time lines, select figures (polymath Zhang Heng; computer visionary Ada Lovelace) earn closer looks. Several dozen additional profiles of other inventors are gathered together in a closing section. Occasional nods to bubble gum and breakfast cereal, the bra, traveler's checks, the sandwich, and similar sidelights jazz up the parade of technological marvels.

Grandmaster Choa found a significant imbalance in this man's energy body -- specifically in his liver -- and told him that he should see a physician as soon as possible. The man went to the doctor and had a blood test, but the results indicated that his liver was fine. He received no medical treatment. Several months later, however, he developed severe pain in his liver. Tests at that time showed that he had hepatitis. We tell this story to students to demonstrate that we have an energetic anatomy just as we have a physical anatomy, and to illustrate that illnesses manifest in your energy body (also called your energetic anatomy) before they appear in the physical body." </i></p><p><i> -- Master Stephen Co</i> </p><p> Your body already heals itself. You may take antibiotics to combat infections, dose yourself with aspirin to reduce pain, get a cast on a broken wrist, or even have your appendix removed by a surgeon, but drugs and medical procedures themselves don't "heal" you. They reduce inflammation, battle bacteria, or in the case of a cast or operation, make proper healing possible. But your body heals itself. And it does it magnificently. Through some process that we don't fully understand, your body has the amazing, innate ability to repair itself. </p><p> Medical science can explain the neurological and biochemical responses involved in healing a cut finger: The nerves carry the pain message to your brain to indicate a problem; white blood cells rush to the area to combat dirt or germs; platelets clot the blood and begin forming a scab; and the skin cells grow back underneath the scab. But medical science does not know how the body knows how to do this, and it doesn't know what force powers this healing process. </p><p> We know intuitively that there must be a consciousness behind this self-healing ability, one that knows how to work in the same way that our body knows how to breathe without our having to command our lungs to inhale and exhale. We have a storehouse of energy that our body uses for healing. Otherwise, white blood cells wouldn't be able to multiply and carry away infection and inflammation from the site of a cut. Skin cells wouldn't be able to repair and create new tissue. Traditional medical thinking holds that both this healing process and the energy used in it are beyond our willful control. But what if you could consciously control this supposedly unconscious self-healing process? What if you could learn to harness the most vital component in that process, the healing energy that your body uses to repair itself? What if you could learn to increase and direct that healing energy to improve your general well-being and relieve specific health problems? </p><p> This book will give you that ability. </p><p><br> <b>Harnessing Your Healing Energy</b> </p><p> Through a series of step-by-step, easy-to-learn, simple-to-perform exercises, you will learn to harness your body's healing energy, the force that is known as chi to the Chinese, mana to the Polynesians, and prana throughout India. You will learn an entire system of self-healing that uses as its framework the principles of one of the most comprehensive, effective forms of energy medicine, called Pranic Healing. </p><p><br> <b>Energy Medicine</b> </p><p> Energy medicine is a broad category of alternative healing methods that utilize universal life force as their primary healing modality. Although some energy medicine is used as an alternative to allopathic, or Western, medicine, most methods are now used as a complement to care given by medical doctors and other traditional treatments. <i>We strongly recommend that you use Pranic Healing only as an adjunct to your physician's care.</i> </p><p> In energy medicine, good health results from having the right amount of this energy flowing smoothly through the body, while health problems or ailments result from a deficiency or blockage of this energy. Energy medicine typically includes some method of increasing or stimulating the amount of life force in the body to facilitate healing. Some systems advocate drawing in the energy from a source outside the body; others teach practitioners to build up their own vital force and then use that for healing. Some incorporate self-healing; others do not. Acupuncture, <i>chi kung,</i> Reiki, Therapeutic Touch, and Pranic Healing are just several examples of energy medicine. </p><p> Acupuncture is probably the most well-known energy medicine system today. In acupuncture, fine needles are inserted into a patient's body at certain points, along energy channels called <i>meridians</i> (see "Your Energetic Anatomy" below for more on meridians). These needles unblock the flow of life force, or <i>chi,</i> through the meridians, and thus balance the body's energy and facilitate healing. Occasionally, the acupuncturist gently rotates the needles or even sends a very low-grade electrical current through them to accelerate the healing process. </p><p> <i><i>chi kung</i></i> (literal translation: "energy work") stems from the same Oriental philosophical base as acupuncture, traditional Chinese medicine, and internal Chinese martial arts, such as tai chi. It consists of a variety of life force-generating exercises and practices that date back thousands of years. There are many different types of <i><i>chi kung,</i></i> but in general, <i><i>chi kung</i></i> practitioners perform a prescribed set of breathing routines and physical exercises over a period of years to enable them to build up the <i>chi</i> in their own bodies. They then project that energy into the body of the patient to bring about healing. You'll learn a different, more effective way to generate energy that is unique to Pranic Healing. </p><p> Reiki is a Japanese hands-on energy-channeling system believed to have its origins in the esoteric practices of Tibetan monks. Reiki practitioners must be "attuned" to the universal healing energy by a Reiki master, after which they are able to draw in this life force and allow it to flow through them into the body of a person in need of healing. There are three levels of Reiki training: first degree, second degree, and third degree, or Reiki master. </p><p> Therapeutic Touch is a method of energy healing incorporating techniques from traditional Chinese medicine, Ayurveda, and laying on of hands. It was developed in the 1970s by a nurse, Delores Krieger, Ph.D., R.N., at New York University School of Nursing, and Dora Kunz, a healer and author, and is comparable to first-degree Reiki. A Therapeutic Touch practitioner does not actually touch the patient but passes his hands lightly over the patient's body to detect and then "unruffle" -- in Therapeutic Touch terminology -- energetic blockages. The practitioner then directs energy into the patient to assist healing. </p><p><br> <b>Pranic Healing</b> </p><p> Pranic Healing was created by a Chinese-Filipino spiritual teacher and energy master named Grandmaster Choa Kok Sui, who spent years researching the root teachings of esoteric systems such as yoga, <i><i>chi kung,</i></i> Kaballah (an ancient Jewish mystical-spiritual tradition), and many others in order to create a simple, practical, effective, "optimum" energy healing system that anyone could learn and use. </p><p> In his teens Grandmaster Choa was already an accomplished student of yoga and various meditation and spiritual systems. In his twenties, he continued intensive study of higher-level esoteric practices, with a particular focus on the use of vital life force for healing. He concluded that healing, at its most basic, consists of cleansing and energizing -- that is, cleaning away dirty or blocked life force from the aura and replenishing the aura with fresh energy. Next, Grandmaster Choa, who by this time had also established himself as a businessman and engineer, applied a rigorous scientific approach to his inquiries. He set up a number of healing clinics in the Philippines to test the effectiveness of laying on of hands, <i>chi kung,</i> and other energy healing systems. Each patient who came in received a particular type of energetic treatment, and the results -- or lack of results -- of that particular treatment for that specific ailment were recorded. Grandmaster Choa also had highly skilled healers with heightened sensitivity -- people with the ability to see vital life force in the body -- observe the patients before and after treatment, so that he could detail the exact energetic effect of each system. These experiments were overseen by nurses and other medical professionals, as well. </p><p> These healing clinics continued for years, with Grandmaster Choa constantly testing and refining methods of cleaning out dirty energy and increasing the supply of healing energy. Finally, in 1987, Grandmaster Choa published his first book and held his first workshop in the Philippines to introduce Pranic Healing, a "best of the best" system of very specific instructions and sequences for cleansing and energizing particular parts of the body to achieve rapid healing. The system spread to the United States in 1990 and is now practiced worldwide. </p><p><br> <b>Pranic Healing Compared with Other Types of Energy Medicine</b> </p><p> Pranic Healing is a more comprehensive and treatment-specific form of energy medicine than the two more contemporary systems, Reiki and Therapeutic Touch, and it is simpler to learn and easier to apply than the ancient, formal Chinese systems acupuncture and <i>chi kung.</i> Additionally, Pranic Healing includes teachings rarely found in other energy medicine systems, such as the detailed use of colored pranas and the practice of <i>energetic hygiene.</i> </p><p> Like Reiki and Therapeutic Touch, Pranic Healing teaches practitioners to feel for disturbances in the aura. But the Pranic Healing version of this tactile technique, called scanning, is more explicit and precise. For instance, Pranic Healing teaches several simple exercises that help students open and sensitize the chakras, or power centers, in the palms of their hands. This enables pranic healers to detect both <i>congestion,</i> an energetic blockage, and <i>depletion,</i> an energetic deficiency, as they move their hands over the body of a patient. Pranic Healing also includes two other hands-on techniques: sweeping, which is manually cleaning away congestion or dirty energy, and <i>energizing,</i> which is supplementing areas of pranic insufficiency. Reiki has no comparable sweeping technique, while Therapeutic Touch's unruffling is similar to but not as effective as sweeping. Unruffling resembles what is called in Pranic Healing <i>distributive sweeping,</i> or using the hands to move energy gently from one area to another. But Pranic Healing's sweeping provides more focused, complete removal of energetic congestion, primarily because pranic healers can use several types of hand motions in sweeping, depending on the location and "stubbornness" of the energetic blockage. </p><p> Energizing is much more detailed in Pranic Healing than in either Reiki or Therapeutic Touch, though it is still simple to learn. Both Reiki and Therapeutic Touch practitioners channel energy into the body of the patient, and there is some rudimentary targeting of the energy to areas where the patient has discomfort, or where the practitioner feels an energetic disturbance. In Pranic Healing, though, for each specific health problem there is a specific sequence for cleaning and energizing particular parts of the body and particular chakras so that the prana is utilized to maximum healing effect. </p><p> While it is based upon some of the tenets that underpin both acupuncture and <i>chi kung,</i> Pranic Healing is easier to learn and use. As in acupuncture, Pranic Healing works with the meridians, but unlike acupuncture Pranic Healing concentrates on only the largest meridians, along which the major chakras lie. Hundreds of other, smaller meridians criss-cross the body, but by performing focused energy work on the large meridians, which feed the others, pranic healers can achieve more effective results in a much shorter period of time. And of course, pranic healers, unlike acupuncturists, needn't study for years to learn the location and path of those smaller meridians and which organs and parts of the body they energize. </p><p> There are numerous <i>chi kung</i> schools and thus many types of <i>chi kung</i> healing techniques. <i>chi kung</i> routines, or "sets" of physical and breathing exercises, were developed by Chinese monks centuries ago to supplement their spiritual development and martial arts training, and also to facilitate physical healing. The biggest differences between <i>chi kung</i> and Pranic Healing lie in their energy-generation philosophies and the length of time needed to become proficient in the practice. <i>chi kung</i> relies on internal generation of energy, which means that students learn techniques to help them build up and store energy within their body. They then tap this surplus for meditation, spiritual development, fighting, and healing. Pranic Healing, by contrast, is an external-generation system. Students are taught powerful techniques that enable them to draw in energy from outside the body and then project it into areas of deficiency for healing. Thus, pranic healers don't have to worry about their energy battery "running down." Pranic healers also don't have to spend years learning and practicing complex physical exercises and breathing patterns to build up the level of internal energy needed to heal effectively. </p><p> Finally, missing from nearly all other energy medicine systems are two cornerstones of Pranic Healing: the methodical use of colored pranas, which focus and greatly accelerate the healing process, and <i>energetic hygiene,</i> or rules and practices for avoiding energetic contamination and keeping the practitioner's personal energy tank clean and full. </p><p><br> <b>Your Energetic Anatomy</b> </p><p> Pranic Healing teaches that illness and health problems result from disturbances to the flow of prana through a network of power centers, passageways, and energy fields that interpenetrate the physical body called the <i>energetic anatomy.</i> Your energetic anatomy, also called your <i>energy body,</i> or simply, your <i>aura,</i> is a three-dimensional cloud of prana that begins inside your physical body and emanates outward in all directions to form a rough outline around your body. The energetic anatomy has five basic components: </p><p> 1. The <i>chakras,</i> the body's power centers or transformers that take in and distribute prana.<br> 2. The <i>meridians,</i> the body's energy channels that transfer prana to and from the chakras and nearby organs and parts of the body.<br> 3. The <i>inner aura,</i> an inner shell of prana that begins inside the body and extends about 5 inches out from the body in a healthy adult.<br> 4. The <i>outer aura</i>, an outer shell of prana that also begins inside the body and extends up to several feet beyond the inner aura in a healthy adult. The outer aura holds in the body's energy.<br> 5.

When a co-worker loses 20 pounds, or a friend runs a marathon while completing a huge project at work, we assume they have more grit, more willpower, more innate talent, and above all, more motivation to see their goals through.<br> &nbsp;<br> But that's not at actually true, as popular Inc.com columnist Jeff Haden proves. "Motivation" as we know it is a myth. Motivation isn't the special sauce that we require at the beginning of any major change. In fact, motivation is a <i>result </i>of process, not a cause. Understanding this will change the way you approach any obstacle or big goal.<br> &nbsp;<br> Haden shows us how to reframe our thinking about the relationship of motivation to success. He meets us at our level--at the beginning of any big goal we have for our lives, a little anxious and unsure about our way forward, a little burned by self help books and strategies that have failed us in the past&#x2014;and offers practical advice that anyone can use to stop stalling and start working on those dreams.<br> &nbsp;<br> Haden takes the mystery out of accomplishment, proving that success isn't about spiritual awakening or a lightning bolt of inspiration --as Tony Robbins and adherents of The Secret believe--but instead, about clear and repeatable processes. Using his own advice, Haden has consistently drawn 2 million readers a month to his posts, completed a 107-mile long mountain bike race, and lost 10 pounds in a month.<br> &nbsp;<br> Success isn't for the uniquely-qualified; it's possible for any person who understands the true nature of motivation. Jeff Haden can help you transcend average and make lasting positive change in your life.</p><p><b>Jeff Haden</b> is Inc.com's most popular columnist and one of LinkedIn's most widely-followed Influencers. His work has also appeared on <i>Time</i>, <i>The</i> <i>Huffington Post</i>, <i>Fast Company</i>, Business Insider, <i>Entrepreneur</i>, Yahoo! Small Business, MSNBC, and CNBC.Chapter 1<br><br> Motivation Is Not the Spark<br><br> A key moment in Tony Robbins's "Unleash the Power Within" seminar occurs when participants take part in the fire walk.<br><br> (Okay, it's more like a "kinda-hot coals" walk, but "fire" sounds more dangerous and macho and Katy Perry "Roar"-y. After all, Tony does know a little something about branding.)<br><br> (Actually, Tony knows a lot about branding.)<br><br> (And actually, this is the last time I'll take a shot at Tony. I think.)<br><br> Robbins describes the fire walk as "a symbolic experience that proves if you can make it through the fire, you can make it through anything." The premise sounds great: Walking across kinda-hot coals gives you lasting confidence and motivation by tapping into the amazing power lying dormant within you.<br><br> In fact, it doesn't.<br><br> Fire-walking is a one-off event. Fire-walking is like listening to a motivational speech: You go home inspired and excited and all jazzed up . . . but you wake up the next day the same person you were the day before, because you haven't truly accomplished anything.<br><br> (Except listen. And pay for the seminar.)<br><br> Most people are confused about me source of motivation. They think motivation is the spark that automatically produces lasting eagerness to do hard work; the greater the motivation, the more effort you're willing to put in.<br><br> Actually, motivation is a result. Motivation is the pride you take in work you have already done-which fuels your willingness to do even more.<br><br> That's why tips for how to feel more motivated often fall short. Most of that advice can be boiled down to "You can be more motivated. All you have to do is dig deep into your mind and find that motivation within."<br><br> (And burn your feet a little.)<br><br> The same is true for confidence, confidence being closely linked to motivation. The thinking goes, "You can be more confident. All you have to do is decide to be more confident." It's easy: Suppress negative thoughts, suppress negative perspectives, repeat some really cool self-affirmational statements, and . . . presto! I'm like Tony Robbins.<br><br> Or not.<br><br> The main problem in both cases is the way we've come to think about motivation.<br><br> Most definitions of "motivation" involve some phrase like "the force or influence that causes someone to do something." Motivation is viewed as a spark, a precondition, a prerequisite, a presomething that is required before we can start. If we aren't motivated, we can't start. If we aren't motivated, we can't do.<br><br> Bullshit.<br><br> Real motivation comes after you start. Motivation isn't the result of hearing a speech or watching a movie or crisping your soles. Motivation isn't passive; motivation is active.<br><br> How to Start When You're 0 Percent Motivated<br><br> The best way to get motivated is to break a sweat, literally or symbolically.<br><br> Getting started is often the hardest part. Financial planners frequently recommend paying off a small debt first, even though the balance on that bill may carry the lowest interest rate of all your debts. Rationally, that approach makes no sense: If you carry a balance on three credit cards, the card you pay off first should be the one with the highest interest rate. But the thought of paying off, say, a $7,000 balance when you can spare only an extra $200 a month . . . ugh. The time horizon is too long for the payoff-literally-to seem worth it. The "irrational" approach often works better: Working to pay off the card with the smallest balance seems a lot more attainable. Once you start, you can see the difference. Knocking $200 off an $800 debt feels like you've accomplished something. After next month, you're halfway done! And once you pay off that card, you'll be motivated to keep going to pay off the next card.<br><br> Think about why you sometimes procrastinate. (Don't say you never put things off. Show me someone who doesn't procrastinate and I'll show you a robot. Everyone procrastinates.)<br><br> I definitely procrastinate.<br><br> One example: I've written more than seven million published words. (Please keep the jokes about long-windedness to yourself.) You might then assume it's easy for me to sit down and write, but at times it's anything but: I'll make calls, take care of administrative tasks, do a little "research" (in my line of work, any reading is research, right?), play with the cats . . . I love to write, but sometimes the thought of writing seems daunting, especially at the beginning of a project, when I need to find the right voice and the best way into the material.<br><br> Except for the cats, I can rationalize that I'm being productive, but usually I'm just procrastinating.<br><br> Another example: I like to ride bicycles. Over the last five or six years I've ridden about 35,000 miles. I love riding, but sometimes I'll do anything not to ride.<br><br> Neither makes sense, right? Writing and riding are both things I love to do, yet at times I find ways to actively avoid doing them. Putting off tasks I don't enjoy would make a lot more sense.<br><br> I love to ride my bike, but sometimes the thought of riding seems daunting, especially those first few miles, when it's cold outside and my legs are stiff and my heart has just started to pound. I pant and gasp and wonder why I'm on the stupid bike . . . but then something magical happens. Somehow my aversion to "hard" goes away once I break a sweat.<br><br> The endorphins kick in. My legs warm up. I feel proud that I can do something hard, and do it reasonably well. That rush of satisfaction I always feel? (That rush of satisfaction you always feel when you start doing something you've put off . . . and suddenly realize it wasn't as daunting as you anticipated?) I know that feeling will come. I've trained myself to anticipate that natural "high." Instead of thinking, "Ugh. This is going to be hard," I've taught myself to think, "I can't wait for that little high I'll feel when I move from inactivity to activity. I can't wait to feel that rush I know I'll feel when I'm actually doing what I planned to do."<br><br> The key is to enjoy the feeling of success that comes from improving in some small way . . . and then rinse and repeat, over and over again.<br><br> Why? Improving feels good. Improving breeds confidence. Improving creates a feeling of competence, and competence breeds self-confidence. Success-in your field or sometimes in any field-breeds motivation. It feels good to improve . . . so you naturally want to keep improving.<br><br> You've probably put off a task, finally gotten started . . . and then, once you got started, thought, "I don't know why I kept putting this off. It's going really well. And it didn't turn out to be nearly as hard as I imagined."<br><br> And here's the thing: It never is.<br><br> Why? Because once you get started, once you get active and start doing something-doing not just anything but something you know will get you one step closer to your goal-the process gets easier. Motivation kicks in because you've gotten started. A really cool virtuous cycle-one we'll look at in detail a little later-kicks in. You feel good because you're engaged and involved.<br><br> You feel motivated because you took action. Motivation is a result, not a precondition. You don't need motivation to break a sweat. Break a sweat and you'll feel motivated.<br><br> The best way to get motivated is to break a sweat, literally or figuratively. Once you start, it's easy to keep going. The act of getting out of the house to go for a jog is often harder than actually running the five miles you planned. The act of sitting down at your desk to start writing a proposal is often harder than putting together twenty pages of material. The act of picking up your phone is often harder than cold-calling twenty prospects.<br><br> AU: Sentence is identical to p13 line 19<br><br> Starting is hard because "motivation" doesn't make it easy to start. Starting provides the motivation to finish.<br><br> Fire walks don't provide lasting motivation. Breaking a sweat provides lasting motivation.<br><br> Speeches don't provide lasting motivation. Progress provides lasting motivation.<br><br> Posters don't provide lasting motivation. Success provides lasting motivation.<br><br> If you aren't achieving your goals, a lack of motivation or confidence isn't the problem. A lack of motivation or confidence is actually the means to a solution. When you accept your weak points, when you accept your flaws, when you accept your imperfections . . . that's when you can motivate yourself to make changes and improve.<br><br> Hide from your weaknesses, and you'll always be weak. Accept your weaknesses and work to improve them, and you'll eventually be stronger-and more motivated to keep improving.<br><br> But you have to do the right things in order to make real improvements. In upcoming chapters I'll show you how.<br><br> Before we do that, though, let's debunk some other myths that have held you back.<br><br> Shortcuts Never Get You Where You Really Want to Go<br><br> You know this now, but it bears repeating: Lightning bolts of inspiration strike only in the movies-or in the minds of people who want to believe they're capable of inspiring you (if you pay for the privilege, of course).<br><br> Wait for a sudden burst of inspiration and you'll never get started . . . and if you do manage to ride that initial sugar-rush wave, you'll never stick with it, because sugar rushes never last.<br><br> The same is true for seeking shortcuts. You can't "hack" your way to success.<br><br> I love Tim Ferriss, but don't fool yourself: He works incredibly hard. The real premise of The 4-Hour Workweek is to increase your output by ten times per hour. Tim is the first to admit he has no problem with hard work-the key is to apply your hard work to the right things. But somehow that premise has been twisted to become "I just need to find the secret (something) that results in instant success."<br><br> Of course there are no hacks. Sure, you can learn to peel a banana a lot more effectively (thanks, Tim!), but real success, meaningful success, is never instant. You absolutely should look for better, more effective ways to accomplish your goal-and I'll show you several-but there are no shortcuts.<br><br> There definitely aren't for me.<br><br> I'm as insecure as anyone I know. Where feeling confident and self-assured is concerned, on a scale of one to one hundred, one hundred being Oprah, I'm a one.<br><br> So some years ago when I was invited to speak to an audience of around 1,000 people, my first thought was "Yes!" My second thought was "Oh no!" I had never spoken to an audience larger than about 150 people. Plus, I had been asked to speak on an unfamiliar topic.<br><br> Even so, the opportunity was too good to pass up. So I looked around and found a few articles with tips on how to captivate a large audience; it seemed all I needed to do was employ some big nonverbal gestures and speak more loudly at some points and softly at others, and boom: I'd kill.<br><br> Nope. I bombed.<br><br> Granted, everyone told me I did fine. (To a speaker, being told you were "fine" is like being a teenager who is told he has a good personality.) Sure, I wanted to believe them. I wanted desperately to ignore my feelings of incompetence, disappointment, and failure.<br><br> And then I realized I would never get better if I didn't (1) accept the fact that I had failed and (2) work really hard to improve. So I went back to the drawing board. I wrangled invitations to local civic groups. I spoke to students at local colleges. I forced myself to speak on topics outside my wheelhouse so I could learn the mechanics of crafting a great hook and a great story.<br><br> Sometimes I did well, sometimes I did poorly, but over time I gained competence and skill.<br><br> Am I still nervous before I step out in front of a large crowd? Oh, hell yeah. I'm a hot mess of insecurity. But I can work through those feelings, not because I engage in a lot of happy horseshit self-talk and fire-walking bravado but because I know I've been there, done that, and can do it again. I'm confident because I have success in my pocket. I'm confident because I've done the work.<br><br> Confidence comes from preparation. Hesitation, anxiety, fear . . . Those feelings don't come from some deep, dark, irrational place inside you. The anxiety you feel-the lack of confidence you feel-comes from feeling unprepared. Once you realize that you can prepare yourself, that you can develop techniques to do whatever you seek to do well, that whatever you hope to achieve is ultimately a craft that you can learn to do better and better and better, and that any skills you currently lack you can learn, you naturally become more confident as you become more prepared.<br><br> Take Jamie Little, a pit reporter for Fox Sports and the first woman to accomplish several motor sports broadcasting milestones.<br><br> "When my mom and I moved to Las Vegas," she says, "I met Carey Hart [motocross racer, freestyle motocross competitor, married to Pink]. He had a big influence on me. I thought he was the coolest thing ever. I already had a thing for motorcycles, and I learned about Supercross through him. I would take dirt-bike magazines to class with me. . . . I loved it. It was my happy world.<br><br> "I went up to a guy working for ESPN at a race and said, 'How do I get started?' He let me hang out for two years with no pay so I could get my work known. I learned to write; I learned to interview athletes. . . . It was a great training ground. I wasn't getting paid, but that was okay."<br><br> But that doesn't mean her path was easy. When Jamie started working for ESPN covering NASCAR races, the challenges only increased.<br><br> "I don't think there was anything harder I could have taken on than covering NASCAR at that level," she says. "I look back and wonder where I got the courage. I was coming into this garage; there weren't a whole lot of people before me that had done it, especially not women. . . . I had to figure things out on my own, which was the best way but also the most challenging way.<br><br> "My confidence came from overpreparing. I still overprepare. I put together a page of notes for every driver, talk to the drivers and crew chiefs at the track . . . and then I use all that to help me trim the fat down to the most pertinent facts and the best angles to share with viewers during the broadcast. I use that same approach with other forms of racing. Feeling overprepared lets me feel confident and natural."</p><h2>The Politics of Jesus: Rediscovering the True Revolutionary Nature of Jesus&#39; Teachings and How They Have Been Corrupted</h2><p><p>Who was Jesus? And how was this first-century political revolutionary, whose teachings are meant to lead the way to freedom, turned into a meek and mild servant of the status quo? How is it possible to profess a belief in Jesus, yet ignore the suffering of the poor and the needy? Just how truly faithful to the vision of Jesus are the many politicians who claim to be Christian? These are the kinds of questions Obery Hendricks, a biblical scholar, activist, and minister, asks in this provocative new book. In this day and age of heated political debate, Hendricks&#x2019;s <i>The Politics of Jesus</i> stands out as much for its brilliant re-creation of the life and mind of Jesus of Nazareth as for its scathing critique of modern politicians &#x201c;of faith.&#x201d;</p></p><p>OBERY M. HENDRICKS, JR., is a professor of biblical interpretation at the New York Theological Seminary, an Ordained Elder in the African Methodist Episcopal Church, and the author of <i>Living Water</i>.

He lives in New Jersey.<b>ONE<br><br>From the Red Sea to the Jordan River: The Roots of Jesus' Political Consciousness</b><br><br>"<i>Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets; I have come not to abolish, but to fulfill.</i>"<br>Matthew 5:17<br>If Jesus was a political revolutionary, what were the political issues and conditions of the world of his birth that he was responding to and that he sought so fervently to change? To fully appreciate the politics of Jesus we must begin with the most basic factor in his worldview and social identity: his Jewishness. We will briefly survey the major historical moments in the development of the religion of Jesus and note how the influence of each is reflected in his message and ministry. In other words, we must begin with an understanding of the legacy of the Judaism into which Jesus was born and its influence on his life and his every pronouncement.<br><br>***<br><br>Jesus of Nazareth was a Jew. Not only was Jesus a Jew, but he was an observant Jew who never disavowed his Jewishness. We see this in his consistent observance of Jewish customs and holy days, in his frequent references to Moses, and in his acceptance of the Torah as holy writ. All of Jesus' major teachings either were consistent with the tenets of traditional Judaism or were expansions or elaborations of it, as in Matthew 5:17-48, in which Jesus intensifies the moral ethics of Judaism with the refrain "you have heard it said . . . but <i>I</i> say . . ."*<br><br>However, the major implication of Jesus' Jewishness for our understanding of the political setting of his life and ministry goes beyond the liturgical and doctrinal aspects of Judaism. Rather, it lies in one fact in particular: that the root event from which the foundational meaning of Judaism and the entire Judeo-Christian faith tradition flows is a political event--the liberation event that was the Exodus.<br><b>The Exodus</b><br><br>The Bible begins with the Book of Genesis, which includes the stories of increasingly faithful individuals like Joseph, Abraham, and Lot. The next book, Exodus, recounts the struggle of the Hebrew people to escape from their painful bondage under Pharaoh, the Egyptian ruler. With the Hebrews' exit from Egypt, the emphasis of the Bible turns from individual deliverance to collective deliverance. It is in this sense that the Exodus event is a political event: it is about the collective deliverance of a subjugated class of people from political oppression and economic exploitation.<br><br>The political nature of the Exodus is epitomized in Exodus 3:7-8, which narrates God's liberating response to the cries of the oppressed: "I have observed the misery of my people who are in Egypt; I have heard their cry on account of their taskmasters. Indeed, I know their sufferings, and I have come down to deliver them."<br><br>What we are told here is that it was not the Hebrews' religious sensibilities, nor was it their worship pieties, that accounted for God's intervention in their desperate predicament. Rather, according to God's own testimony, it was their political plight. In fact, the book of Exodus tells us that when it came to worshiping God, the Hebrews were not particularly commendable. As a group, they seem not even to have been monotheistic; that is, they seem not to have fully accepted belief in one God alone. Apparently they were what we call henotheistic, which means that even if they did worship only one God, they still acknowledged the existence of other deities. This is reflected in the first commandment, in which the Hebrews are specifically commanded to worship no other gods, a commandment that would have been meaningless if they had already believed in the existence of only one God. Thus, the liberating action of God in the Exodus was not in response to the worship pieties of the Hebrews. It <i>was to their political plight</i>.<br><br>The term "Hebrews" itself confirms this, in that it is primarily a sociopolitical identity--specifically a class identity--rather than a religious identity. In the Hebrew language, the term 'ibri, or "Hebrew," means literally "he crossed over," which reflects the Hebrews' status as "outsiders" to Egyptian society. Moreover, the use of "Hebrew" as a term of social or class description seems to be related to the early Semitic term hapiru, which most scholars believe also connoted outsider class status in the ancient Near East. This sense of "outsider" is reflected by the Exodus narrative in its own presentation of the Hebrews as in every way outcasts and aliens to the social and political mainstream of Egypt. Indeed, the Book of Exodus graphically portrays the Hebrews as a despised and socially marginalized class. The ethic of compassion for the ger, or "alien stranger," that permeates the Hebrew Bible from this point has much to do with the Hebrews' treatment in Egypt.<br><br>Thus, in effect, the testimony of the Exodus is that the defining root event from which Israel sprang was God's act of taking the side of the oppressed. In the final analysis, the seminal importance of the Exodus event is that in God's response to the class oppression of the Hebrews, God firmly posited justice and liberation as the very foundation of biblical faith.<br><br>From the moment of the Hebrews' final deliverance from the murderous grasp of Pharaoh, the Exodus liberation event loomed large in their collective consciousness. In fact, the people of Israel have recalled their oppression and their emancipation from it during the annual Passover seder, or feast, for some five thousand years with these words: "We were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt, but the Lord our God brought us forth with a mighty hand and with an outstretched arm."<br><b><i>The Significance of the Exodus for the Ministry of Jesus</i></b><br><br>As the root event of Judaism, the Exodus liberation experience is also the root event of Jesus' faith and his message. Jesus evokes the memory of the Exodus often in the Gospels by repeatedly invoking Moses' name. And just as God declared the oppression of the Hebrews as the motive for divine intervention, Jesus cites the oppression of his people as the focus of his own intervention--his ministry--by choosing the liberation text of Isaiah 61:1-2 as his manifesto: "The Spirit of the Lord . . . has anointed me . . . to bring good news to the poor" (Luke 4:18). Mark's account of Jesus' liberation of a young man possessed by "an unclean spirit" named "Legion" even evokes the image of Pharaoh's defeat at the Red Sea: "And the unclean spirits . . . numbering about two thousand . . . rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and were drowned in the sea" (Mark 5:13).<br><b>The Biblical Judges</b><br><br>As a class rather than a group sharing an ethnic or religious identity, the Hebrews consisted of a number of different tribes. The Song of Deborah in Judges 5:14-18 lists ten tribes. After their deliverance from Egypt they spent years wandering in the desert, during which time other tribes apparently united with them, eventually increasing their number to twelve.<br><br>When they finally settled in Canaan, for generations the painful memory of their experience under Egypt's hereditary monarchy helped the Hebrews withstand the temptation to institute a monarchy among themselves. Though the prophet Samuel actually represents a later historical moment than that recounted in the Book of Judges, the fears behind the Hebrews' rejection of a monarchy can be heard nonetheless in Samuel's warning that a king would "take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive orchards and give them to his courtiers . . . And in that day you will cry out because of your king" (1 Samuel 8:14, 18).<br><br>Instead of instituting a monarchy, the tribes of the Hebrews developed an egalitarian form of governance by a confederacy, or governing council, made up of representatives of all their tribes and factions. The united tribes came to be called collectively "Israel." Their confederate form of governance is seen at work in Joshua 24:1: "Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and summoned the elders, the heads, the judges, and the officers of Israel" to jointly confer.<br><br>This era of egalitarian governance without the oversight of a king came to be known as the period of the "judges" (shophetim in Hebrew, i.e., "those who do justice," from mishpat, "justice"), as leaders who fought to preserve the Israelites' freedom were called. Their story is told in the appropriately named Book of Judges.<br><br>The Book of Judges consists of a series of popular tales that tell the story of the free tribes of Israel resisting foreign oppression. These accounts include the story of Othniel of the tribe of Caleb, who led a peasant militia that freed Israel from the oppression of the Canaanite king Cushan-rishathaim (Judges 3:7-11); of Ehud the Benjaminite, who successfully led a revolt against Eglon, king of Moab (Judges 3:15-30); and of the judge Deborah's defeat of Sisera, general of the Canaanite king Jabin (Judges 4 and 5).<br><br>What all these judges had in common was their role of freedom fighter. They were individuals who rose to temporarily assume the political leadership of Israel when the freedom of the Hebrew people was threatened. The Book of Judges itself says as much: "Then the Lord raised up judges, who delivered them out of the power of those who plundered them" (Judges 2:16).<br><br>As with the earlier Hebrews, the outstanding characteristic of the biblical judges was not religiosity. Rather, the main qualification for biblical judges was a willingness to fight for their people's freedom. For instance, the Bible characterizes Samson, the best known of the judges, as driven more by his ultimately disastrous romance with Delilah than by religious concerns. Yet despite a life of dissipation, Samson maintains a place of honor in the biblical memory because his dying act was to strike a blow against the enemies of his fellow Hebrews.<br> <br>In addition to the rise of individual freedom fighters as de facto generals in periods of military threat, there is another significant aspect of the period of the judges that influenced the development of the political and ethical structure of Israel: by selecting individuals as temporary leaders to rule only in times of crisis, Israel decisively rejected the idea of a king or even a centralized government. Instead, it chose to be a free and independent people with no ruling class to lord over it. In that time and place, the choice to bow to no king and to pay tribute only to God was truly revolutionary.<br><br><b><i>The Significance of the Judges for the Ministry of Jesus</i></b><br><br>The primary lesson of the biblical judges is that fighting for the liberation of those who are oppressed is as important a responsibility of our faith as developing sound personal piety. It appears that this principle has largely been forgotten in Christendom. Yet it is repeatedly echoed by Jesus in his insistence that in addition to striving to better know the will of God in their personal lives and conduct, his hearers should also do justice in the world. Jesus stressed this point in such sayings as "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst after<i> justice</i>" (Matthew 5:6) and "Seek first God's kingdom and God's <i>justice</i>" (Matthew 6:33).<br><br>You'll note that I have rendered the Greek word <i>dikaiosune</i> in these verses as "justice" rather than the usual "righteousness." As students of biblical Greek know, the term can be translated either way. However, unlike "righteousness," with its strictly one-dimensional personal moral implications, "justice" connotes more than individual piety. It also means holistic, collective--that is, <i>social</i>--righteousness. Because of Jesus' holistic spirituality, his use of <i>dikaiosune</i> in these and many of the other sayings in which it is found should be understood as encompassing both of the term's meanings, that is, personal righteousness and social justice.<br><br>Jesus' embrace of the uncompromising egalitarianism of the biblical judges is reflected in his admonition to his disciples: "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones are tyrants over them. It will not be so among you" (Matthew 20:25-26). It is also seen in his unwavering recognition of God alone as sovereign king. When offered "all the kingdoms of the world" by Satan, Jesus made clear his conviction that no kingship but God's is legitimate by quoting the unequivocal declaration of God's sovereignty in Deuteronomy 6:13: "Away with you, Satan! for it is written,/'Worship the Lord your God,/and serve only him' " (Matthew 4:10).<br><br><b>The Judges and the Kingdom of God</b><br><br>The reason underlying the Hebrews' remarkable decision to select judges from among themselves as occasional leaders, rather than have a king as most societies around them did, is precisely the legacy of liberative justice bequeathed to the Hebrews by the Exodus. This attitude of radical political equality--that is, the refusal to accept the domination of anyone except God--is exemplified by the refusal of the biblical judge Gideon of Manasseh to become the hereditary king of Israel: "Then the Israelites said to Gideon, 'Rule over us, you and your son and your grandson also . . .' Gideon said to them, 'I will not rule over you, and my son will not rule over you; the Lord will rule over you' " (Judges 8:22-23).<br><br>Gideon's refusal reflects the pivotal Israelite notion of <i>malkuth shamayim</i>, that is, belief in "the sole sovereignty of God," the recognition that God alone has the right to rule and dominate the life and affairs of Israel in particular, and the rest of the world by extension. This was a fundamental tenet of Judaism, based on no less than the first commandment to Moses at Sinai: "[Y]ou shall have no other gods before me" (Exodus 20:3).<br><br>Three streams of meaning can be discerned in the idea of <i>malkuth shamayim</i>:<br><br>1. God as king of the universe (Psalms 22; 29; 47; 93; 96-99; also Jeremiah 10:7, 10 ff.; Malachi 1:14)<br><br>2. God as the sole king of Israel (Numbers 23:21; Deuteronomy 33:5; Isaiah 41:21; Jeremiah 8:19)<br><br>3. God as king in the eschatological, that is, future sense (1 Samuel 8:19, 12:12)<br><br>Each strand of belief in the right of God alone to rule was significant and widely held. Observant Jews reaffirmed this belief every day, however they understood it, in their daily recitation of the prayer in Deuteronomy 6:4 known as the Shema (from <i>shemayah</i>, "hear"): "Hear O Israel, the Lord your God, the Lord is <i>ahad</i>" (i.e., singular, without peer).<br><br>Despite the various ways <i>malkuth shamayim</i> could be understood, its first stream of meaning--God as universal king--became the basis for all the resistance movements in Israel to come. The radicality of this notion lay in its rejection of all human domination. Its impeccable logic was that if God is the sole king of the universe, no other claim to kingship is legitimate. For common people to declare that they would bow before no earthly king was a dangerous and radical political statement in the ancient world, and they knew it.<br><br>The roots of this revolutionary belief run deep in the history of Israel. Time after time, belief in <i>malkuth shamayim</i> inspired and empowered Israel's fighters for freedom. A particularly poignant example is found in a Jewish religious book of the first century b.c. called First Maccabees, which can be found in the Catholic Bible and the collection of ancient Jewish religious texts known as the Apocrypha.<br><br>First Maccabees recounts the history of the Israelites' rebellion against their Greek occupiers that began about 167 b.c. The conflict was triggered by an edict that all Jews must recognize the Greek king Antiochus IV as Epiphanes (God manifest) and swear fealty to him and his own...</p><h2>Apollo 13</h2><p>In April 1970, during the glory days of the Apollo space program, NASA sent Navy Captain Jim Lovell and two other astronauts on America's fifth mission to the moon. Only fifty-five hours into the flight of Apollo 13, disaster struck: a mysterious explosion rocked the ship, and soon its oxygen and power began draining away. Written with all the color and drama of the best fiction, APOLLO 13 (previously published as Lost Moon) tells the full story of the moon shot that almost ended in catastrophe. Minutes after the explosion, the three astronauts are forced to abandon the main ship for the lunar module, a tiny craft designed to keep two men alive for just two days. As the hours tick away, the narrative shifts from the crippled spacecraft to Mission Control, from engineers searching desperately for a way to fix the ship to Lovell's wife and children praying for his safe return. The entire nation watches as one crisis after another is met and overcome. By the time the ship splashes down in the Pacific, we understand why the heroic effort to rescue Lovell and his crew is considered by many to be NASA's finest hour.<br>Now, thirty years after the launch of the mission, Jim Lovell and coauthor Jeffrey Kluger add a new preface and never-before-seen photographs to Apollo 13. In their preface, they offer an incisive look at America's waxing and waning love affair with space exploration during the past three decades, culminating only recently when the Apollo 13 spacecraft itself, long consigned to an aviation museum outside Paris, was at last returned to its rightful home in the United States. As inspiring today as it was thirty years ago, the story of Apollo 13 is a timeless tribute to the enduring American spirit and sparkling individual heroism.</p><p>On April 13, 1970, three American astronauts were on their way to the moon when a mysterious explosion rocked their ship, forcing them to abandon the main ship and spend four days in the tiny lunar module which was intended to support two men for two days. A harrowing story of danger, courage and brilliant off-the-cuff engineering solutions which resulted in a dramatic rescue.On April 13, 1970, astronauts Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert were hurtling along in the Apollo 13 spacecraft, on America's fifth mission to the moon, when a mysterious explosion rocked the ship. The cockpit grew dim, the air grew thin, and the instrument lights winked out. Moments later, the astronauts were forced to abandon the main for the tiny lunar module, designed to keep two men alive for just two days. But there were now three men aboard, and they were four days from home. As the action shifts from the disabled ship to the frantic engineers at Mission Control to Lovell's anxious family, <i>Apollo 13</i> brilliantly recreates the harrowing, heroic rescue mission in all its drama and glory.</p><h2>Top 10 Games You Can Play In Your Head, By Yourself: Second Edition</h2><p><p><b>YOUR MIND IS NOW THE ULTIMATE GAMING ENGINE.</b></p><br>Top 10 Games You Can Play In Your Head, By Yourself, is a collection of visionary author J.

Taylor's&nbsp;<i>Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry</i>,<i>&nbsp;</i>with cover art by two-time Caldecott Honor Award winner Kadir Nelson!</b><br><br>The son of a prosperous landowner and a former slave, Paul-Edward Logan is unlike any other boy he knows. His white father has acknowledged him and raised him openly-something unusual in post-Civil War Georgia. But as he grows into a man he learns that life for someone like him is not easy. Black people distrust him because he looks white. White people discriminate against him when they learn of his black heritage. Even within his own family he faces betrayal and degradation. So at the age of fourteen, he sets out toward the only dream he has ever had: to find land every bit as good as his father's, and make it his own. Once again inspired by her own history, Ms. Taylor brings truth and power to the newest addition to the award-winning Logan family stories.<br><b>* "Readers...will grab this and be astonished by its powerful story."&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i>, starred review<br><br>* "Taylor's gift for combining history and storytelling is as evident here as in her other stories about the Logan family."&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i>, starred review</b></p><p><i>The Land</i> is Mildred D. Taylor's wonderful prequel to her Newbery Medal winner, <i>Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry</i>. In the stories Taylor has to tell, life is not fair, hard work doesn't always pay off, and the good guy doesn't always win. That's because this extraordinary author tells the stories of her African American family in the Deep South during and after the Civil War, a time of ugly, painful racism. <p> Paul-Edward Logan, the son of a white, plantation-owner father and a slave mother, is our narrator, bound and determined to buy his own land and shape his own future at whatever cost. Caught between black and white worlds and not fitting into either one is devastating for him, but his powerful, engaging tales of the love of family, the strength of friendship, and growing up will inspire anyone to dare to persevere despite terrible odds. Taylor's books are not only essential in understanding what led up to the Civil Rights movement in America--they are also breathtaking page-turners, full of suspense, humor, love, and hope. <i>The Land</i> certainly stands alone, but the other award-winning tales of the Logan family--<i>Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry</i>; <i>Let the Circle Be Unbroken</i>; and <i>The Road to Memphis</i>--are excellent as well.

Once Granny sets her mind on something, however, it's difficult&#x2014;and often hazardous&#x2014;to dissuade her.

A ghost in a white mask is murdering, well, quite a lot of people, and two witches (it really isn't wise to call them "meddling, interfering old baggages"), or perhaps three, take a hand in unraveling the mystery.

According to Pierre Pradervand, making the conscious choice to bless every person or being around you can truly make a world of difference in yourself and in others around you. In <i>The Gentle Art of Blessing</i>, Pradervand shows that the practice of blessing has the power to create more than just a renewed perspective. It unleashes tangible benefits throughout your entire life -- through your daily interactions, your life-long relationships, and in the way your approach your place in the world. <br> <br> Pradervand describes blessing as genuinely wishing the best for another person through seeing their individual worth and honoring them for it. By looking at several different perspectives -- providing spiritual inspiration from Hinduism, Taoism, the Koran, the Bible, and other important spiritual sources -- <i>The Gentle Art of Blessing</i> explores the potential in shifting one's attitude from confrontation and negativity to acceptance and enthusiasm. A powerfully simple way of perceiving and shaping our surroundings, blessings can reflect the unconditional love and acceptance that is necessary for world -- and inner -- peace.</p><p>Pierre Pradervand has worked for decades in personal development social justice. His impressive career includes work on nearly every continent, and as a speaker and workshop facilitator, Pierre is often gives talks on the topic of how to live differently. In his workshops, he provides personal development tools that empower everyone to find and strengthen their internal anchors.There are no words to express the enjoyment and renewal that I received in reading this book.

Learning targets. Written from students' point of view, a learning target describes a lesson-sized chunk of information and skills that students will come to know deeply.

Since that fateful trip some 20 years ago, Thailand has become David's second home. Working alongside cooks who perfected their craft in the Thai royal palaces, he began to document the traditional recipes and culinary techniques that have been handed down from generation to generation. <br><br>The result is THAI FOOD, the most comprehensive account of this ancient and exotic cuisine ever published in English. David writes about Thailand and its food with an easy erudition, encouraging readers to cook and experiment, while simultaneously fostering a respect for the food and its stewardship through the ages. Although all the classic, well-loved recipes are here, this magnum opus features hundreds of lesser-known but equally authentic and delicious Thai dishes that will inspire cooks to go beyond green curry chicken and Thai fish cakes. David's passion and conviction are infectious; complemented by Earl Carter's superb photography, THAI FOOD captures all aspects of the dynamic Thai culture and cuisine.<br><br>� Ten years in the making, this groundbreaking work is one of the cookbook publishing events of the decade.<br><br>� The author's London restaurant, nahm, received a Michelin star in 2002, making it the first Thai restaurant to receive such an honor.<br><br>� Photographed at David's restaurants in Sydney and London, and on location in Thailand, Earl Carter's superb images capture both the essence of Thai food and its rich cultural milieu.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Awards2003 James Beard Award Winner<br><br>2003 IACP Award Winner<br>Reviews<br>&#x201c;Stands out, dauntingly massive, brilliantly magisterial, and, at the same time, bustling with charm, observations, life.&#x201d; <br><i>&#x2014;Saveur</i><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;[S]et a new standard for Asian cookbooks.&#x201d;<i>&#x2014;Saveur </i>(Top 100 Home Cook Edition)</p><p>"Thai cooking is a paradox," writes Australian restaurateur David Thompson in his comprehensive and thus aptly named <i>Thai Food</i>. "It uses robustly flavored ingredients--garlic, shrimp paste, chilies, lemongrass--and yet when they are melded during cooking they arrive at a sophisticated and often subtle elegance." Pursuing this transformation in depth, his book presents hundreds of recipes that celebrate the Thai meal while exploring its historical and cultural context. Readers will delight in the wide selection of authentic dishes like Duck and Spring Onion Soup, Grilled Beef Salad, and Green Chicken Curry with Baby Corn, and relish Thompson's vast appreciation of his subject. Though the recipes are straightforward and workable once ingredients are assembled and techniques understood, those new to Thai cooking may want a less rigorous introduction to the subject. However, anyone with an appetite to explore it on Thompson's terms will benefit immensely.<p> Beginning with an exploration of Thailand's history and culture, the book then presents an extended section on rice, the centerpiece of the Thai meal. The "cookbook" follows, with a systematic introduction to the Thai kitchen, ingredients, and equipment. The chapter "Food Outside the Meal" is devoted to Thai snacks and vendor food, such as Stir-Fried Crisp Fish with Holy Basil. Noodle dishes include an exemplary pad thai, and sweet dishes like Grilled Bananas with Coconut Cream and Turmeric are also offered. </p><p> Readers should know that the recipes, published primarily for an Australian audience, give ingredients in a mix of metric and American measurements and/or with nonmetric equivalents, and that nomenclature is also sometimes foreign ("minced" for "ground" meat, for example). With photos throughout, the book sets a standard for Thai cookbooks to come while helping many cooks achieve the true, richly exotic cuisine. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>DAVID THOMPSON is one of Australia&#39;s foremost chefs, restaurateurs, and cooking writers. He is also an eloquent ambassador for Thai food and culture. His Sydney restaurants, the acclaimed Darley Street Thai and the perennially popular Sailors Thai, have increased the awareness and appreciation of authentic Thai cooking. In July 2001, he opened nahm in London&#39;s Halkin Hotel. Seven months later, nahm was awarded a Michelin star. Currently David Thompson is consulting with the prestigious Suan Dusit college in Bangkok on the preservation of Thai culinary heritage. He divides his time between London and Bangkok.</p><h2>Overground Railroad: The Green Book and the Roots of Black Travel in America</h2><p><b>The first book to explore the historical role and residual impact of the <i>Green Book</i>, a travel guide for black motorists&nbsp;</b><br><br> Published from 1936 to 1966, the <i>Green Book</i> was hailed as the &#x201c;black travel guide to America.&#x201d; At that time, it was very dangerous and di cult for African-Americans to travel because black travelers couldn&#x2019;t eat, sleep, or buy gas at most white-owned businesses.

Infancy is a thing of the past and toddlerhood is straight ahead. A baby still? Not really, but neither is he a toddler and that is the key to understanding this phase of growth. This is a period of great of exchange: baby food is exchanged for table food; the highchair for booster seat; finger feeding replaced with spoon; babbling sounds transition to speaking, the first unsteady steps are conquered by strides of confidence, and the list goes on. Moving forward at a lighting pace, pretoddlers are driven towards a new level of independence, equipped with a mind of their own. Whether a parent is ready or not, a toddler's natural inclination and challenge of 'I do myself' will become increasingly apparent, not to mention frustrating.&nbsp;The drive toward independence is very strong yet, unpredictable. He is always in motion and not easily restrained, directed or controlled, but he needs to be! Boundaries will be tested, rules understood as suggestions, and curiosity will become a force to reckon with. How will a parent meet the unfolding challenges? The answer begins with understanding the various growth transitions of the one-hundred and eighty days linking babyhood with toddlerhood.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Come join 26 year Pediatrician Dr. Robert Bucknam, M.D. and co-author Gary Ezzo, M.A. and the community of 6 million homes in all 50 states and around the world that are finding peace and success with their children in the&nbsp;<i>On Becoming</i>&nbsp;best selling series!</p><p>28 year Pediatrician and father of four - Dr. Robert Bucknam, M.D. says:"Change! &nbsp;It seems to be a way of life for parents. &nbsp; In our rapidly expanding, knowledge based society where technology changes everyday, new innovations impact life styles and the way people learn. &nbsp;Parenting curriculums, once designed to cover large blocks of developmental time are less effective today than years gone by. &nbsp;Precision teaching with concise thoughts for specific age ranges seems to be the way of educational life. &nbsp;Our newest curriculum reflects these changes. &nbsp;The communication and dissemination of early childhood principles are easily and naturally divided into four developmental stages, starting at birth and going to thirty-six months. &nbsp;Each stage represents new growth transitions requiring parents to accommodate the changes taking place as their child's grows. &nbsp;Our early childhood curriculum now include:Stage One: &nbsp;Birth to 5 months--&nbsp;<i>On Becoming Babywise</i>Stage Two: 5 to 12 months --&nbsp;<i>On Becoming Babywise 11</i>Stage Three: &nbsp;12 - 18 months --&nbsp;<i>On Becoming Pretoddlerwise</i>Stage Four: &nbsp;18 - 36 months --<i>&nbsp;On Becoming Toddlerwise</i>Stage Five: &nbsp;36 - 84 months --&nbsp;<i>On Becoming Childwise</i>We continue this series where Babywise 11 left off. &nbsp;During the next 180 days, the newly emerging walking, talking, exploring, child begins a developmental metamorphosis from babyhood to toddlerhood."Dr. Robert Bucknam, M.D., F.A.A.P. is the founder and director of Cornerstone Pediatrics in Louisville, Colorado where he resides with his wife, Gayle, and their four sons.

The author of <i>5,000 Years of Glass</i> and editor of <i>The Art of the Jeweller</i>, he died in 2005. </p><p><b>Preface</b></p> <p>The aim of this book is to bring together jewellery from all the major phases of man's history. The selection, made entirely from the collections of the British Museum, ranges in date from about 5000 BC to the middle of the twentieth century. The scope extends beyond Europe and the ancient cultures of Western Asia to India, Tibet and the Far East and includes certain areas of Africa and America. Owing to the accident of survival and archaeological rediscovery and of opportunity for acquisition, some areas and periods are necessarily more richly represented than others.</p> <p>Jewellery for personal adornment is the main theme, but, in addition, amuletic (protective) jewellery -- in so far as it can be specifically recognised -- is treated separately. The use of cameos in jewellery and the role of finger-rings are two further aspects singled out for individual consideration, partly because both have histories peculiar to themselves.</p> <p>I am deeply grateful to my colleagues in the eight Departments who have given so generously and unsparingly of their time and expertise and who have written on the items from the collections in their care.</p> <p>I would also like to express my appreciation of the work of David Gowers of the Photographic Service, who has photographed all the jewellery specially for this book, using great patience and imagination to capture the intricate and elusive detail of these tiny objects. The great wealth of the Museum's collections was first revealed in the exhibition <i>Jewellery Through 7000 Years</i> of 1976 and its accompanying catalogue. My thanks now go to Celia Clear of British Museum Publications for suggesting that this material might be the basis of a new survey and to Jenny Chattington for all her invaluable work in the production of this book.</p> <p>HUGH TAIT<br> <i>May 1986</i></p> <p><i>Note on the present edition</i><br> A few revisions have been made in the sections on Celtic Europe, Roman Britain, cameos and finger rings to take account of new research and discoveries. The section on Europe AD 1700-1950 has been completely rewritten with new illustrations and includes numerous acquisitions made by the British Museum since 1990.

But he was also a Roman citizen who widely traveled the Mediterranean basin, and was very knowledgeable of the dominant Greek and Roman culture of his day. These two mighty rivers of influence converge in Paul's first letter to the Corinthians. With razor-sharp attention to the text, Kenneth Bailey examines the cultural milieu and rhetorical strategies that shaped this pivotal epistle. He discovers the deep layers of the Hebraic prophetic tradition informing Paul's writing, linking the Apostle with the great prophets of the Old Testament. Throughout, Bailey employs his expert knowledge of Near Eastern and Mediterranean culture to deliver to readers a new understanding of Paul and his world. Familiar passages take on a new hue as they are stripped of standard Western interpretations and rendered back into their ancient setting.</p><p><strong>Kenneth E. Bailey</strong> is an author and lecturer in Middle Eastern New Testament studies. He spent forty years living and teaching New Testament in Egypt, Lebanon, Jerusalem and Cyprus. Bailey has written many books in English and Arabic, including <em>The Cross and the Prodigal, Jacob and the Prodigal</em> and <em>Jesus Through Middle Eastern Eyes</em>."Bailey helps us by giving a different and unique lens, a different vantage point, from which to view the traditional texts and interpretations." (R. Gregory Jenks, Trinity Journal, Spring 2013)<br><br>"There is absolutely no doubt that Bailey is a very skilled writer, that there is a wealth of cultural knowledge that he makes available through this book focusing on 1 Corinthians, and that future scholars can and should benefit from knowledge of Middle Eastern translations. . . . This is a worthwhile volume for students, pastors, and scholars to have in reference to Paul's first letter to the Corinthians." (Nijay K. Gupta, Interpretation: A Journal of Bible and Theology, 67 (1))<br><br>"Bailey has done an important service in identifying these structures and the way in which they can help us understand in a deeper way Paul?s intent in the letter. The book should be a rich resource for interpreters, and especially those who desire to see the rich theology underlying Paul?s practical concerns." (Michelle Lee-Barnewall, Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society, 55(3))<br><br>"Kenneth Bailey's new volume, <em>Paul Through Mediterranean Eyes</em>, is a refreshing reminder that for those willing to mine more deeply into the biblical text, precious gems can really be found. Bailey offers an impressive, and genuinely original, contribution to the study of 1 Corinthians that both New Testament scholars and pastors will appreciate. . . . [he] has produced a tremendous piece of scholarship that is intriguing, illuminating, and distinctive." (Michael J. Kruger, Southeastern Theological Review, Summer 2012)<br><br>"Bailey adds significantly to our understanding of Paul's style. Scholars are challenged to add a solid research footing to take up Bailey's interpretations in their own work. Pastors and teachers will find this an excellent supplement to be used next to several other good commentaries. It will enhance not only their exegesis but also their sermons as they learn both from Paul's theology and his rhetorical skill." (Jack Barentsen, Review of Biblical Literature, June 2012)<br><br>"<em>Paul Through Mediterranean Eyes</em> is a necessary addition to the libraries of all scholars and pastors working in or preaching from 1 Corinthians. Bailey's writing is easy to follow, warm, and lucid. Though making some complex arguments and performing some deep analysis, the author never loses sight of the reader or of his goal to make Paul more accessible rather than less. This book is highly recommended for any serious reader of 1 Corinthians." (Ron C. Fay, Criswell Theological Review)<br><br>"This scholarly yet accessible study is a helpful addition to any bookshelf--even those crowded with commentaries on First Corinthians." (Stephen M. Vantassel, BibleStudy Magazine, January February 2012)<br><br>"New Testament scholars recognize Kenneth Bailey as that rare interpreter with intimate knowledge of Middle Eastern culture, ancient and modern. His latest volume now reveals rumination of the rhetoric that serves Paul's theology and ethics. Bailey's signal achievement is to rebut readings of 1 Corinthians as a haphazard document, obscurely reasoned. At once learned and deeply personal, this commentary will surely stimulate productive debate in the exegesis of one among Paul's weightiest letters." (C. Clifton Black, Otto A. Piper Professor of Biblical Theology, Princeton Theological Seminary)<br><br>"A veteran student and observer of the Middle East, Ken Bailey has distilled his knowledge and experience in this work of deep pastoral sensitivity, allowing the apostle Paul to come into his own in a way that a conventional reading of Paul does not allow or encourage. Bailey's work teems with learning and insight, and, buoyed by a clear, lively style, it instructs as well as it illuminates and elevates. The book is a model of biblical scholarship freed of the cobwebs of the study, and consecrated to the life-giving work of the church. It is a 'double-decker sandwich,' to use Bailey's own figure, in which the sandwich is no less nourishing than the meat between the sandwich. I began reading it and couldn't put it down. Go and do thou likewise." (Lamin Sanneh, D. Willis James Professor of World Christianity, Yale Divinity School)<br><br>"Ken Bailey is pure gold. No writer I can think of has been a greater help for teaching the Scriptures with freshness and clarity. What a gift to have his insights on Paul."

Revisionist in nature, it reaches the conclusion that monarchy is a lesser evil than democracy, but outlines deficiencies in both. Its methodology is axiomatic-deductive, allowing the writer to derive economic and sociological theorems, and then apply them to interpret historical events.</p> <p>A compelling chapter on time preference describes the progress of civilization as lowering time preferences as capital structure is built, and explains how the interaction between people can lower time all around, with interesting parallels to the Ricardian Law of Association. By focusing on this transformation, the author is able to interpret many historical phenomena, such as rising levels of crime, degeneration of standards of conduct and morality, and the growth of the mega-state. In underscoring the deficiencies of both monarchy and democracy, the author demonstrates how these systems are both inferior to a natural order based on private-property.</p> <p>Hoppe deconstructs the classical liberal belief in the possibility of limited government and calls for an alignment of conservatism and libertarianism as natural allies with common goals. He defends the proper role of the production of defense as undertaken by insurance companies on a free market, and describes the emergence of private law among competing insurers.</p> <p>Having established a natural order as superior on utilitarian grounds, the author goes on to assess the prospects for achieving a natural order. Informed by his analysis of the deficiencies of social democracy, and armed with the social theory of legitimation, he forsees secession as the likely future of the US and Europe, resulting in a multitude of region and city-states. This book complements the author's previous work defending the ethics of private property and natural order. Democracy - The God that Failed will be of interest to scholars and students of history, political economy, and political philosophy.</p></p><p>Hans-Hermann Hoppe is currently professor of economics at the University of Nevada Las Vegas, senior fellow of the Ludwig von Mises Institute, Auburn, AL, and editor of the Journal of Libertarian Studies: An Interdisciplinary Quarterly Review.</p><h2>Dracopedia: A Guide to Drawing the Dragons of the World</h2><p><b>Everything you ever wanted to know about dragons, but were afraid to find out!</b><br><br>Fantasy artists can now breathe easier thanks to this less perilous alternative to drawing dragons from life. <i>Dracopedia</i> offers you safe, easy access to the world's most prominent dragon species, from tiny, innocuous feydragons to the ferocious wyvern.<br><br>For years, artist William O'Connor has traveled the globe, studying dragons in their natural environments.

When he left Hollywood in March 1941, Jimmy Stewart was America&#x2019;s boy next door movie star and a recent Academy Award winner. He left all that behind to join the United States Army Air Corps and fulfill his family mission to serve his country&#x2014;only to face obstacle after obstacle from both Hollywood and Washington. Finally he made his way to the European Theater, where several near-death experiences and the loss of men under his command took away his youthful good looks. The war finally won, he returned home with millions of other veterans to face an uncertain future, suffering what we now know as PTSD. That is the man who embarked on <i>It&#x2019;s a Wonderful Life</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> For the next half century, Stewart refused to discuss his combat experiences and took the story of his service to the grave. <i>Mission</i> presents the first in-depth look at Stewart&#x2019;s life as a Squadron Commander in the skies over Germany, from takeoff to landing and every key moment in between.<br> &nbsp;<br> Author Robert Matzen sifted through thousands of Air Force combat reports and the Stewart personnel files; interviewed surviving aviators who flew with Stewart; visited the James Stewart Papers at Brigham Young University; flew in the cockpits of the B-17 Flying Fortress and B-24 Liberator; and walked the earth of air bases in England used by Stewart in his combat missions of 1943-45. What emerges in <i>Mission</i> is the story of a Jimmy Stewart you never knew until now, a story more fantastic than any he brought to the screen.</p><p><b>Robert Matzen</b> is an American author who specializes in Hollywood history. He spent 10 years with NASA and his avid interest in aviation-related topics resulted in the bestsellers <i>Mission: Jimmy Stewart and the Fight for Europe</i> and <i>Fireball: Carole Lombard and the Mystery of Flight 3</i>. He lives in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. <b>Leonard Maltin</b> is a film critic and historian who can be regularly seen on ReelzChannel and Turner Classic Movies. He is the author of the long-running <i>Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide</i> and its companion, <i>Leonard Maltin's Classic Movie Guide</i>. He lives in Los Angeles, California.&#x201c;Even before Hollywood legend Jimmy Stewart went off to war, he was a fighter, working hard to prove his passion for military aviation to the U.S. government. In this meticulously researched book, film historian Matzen (<i>Fireball: Carole Lombard and the Mystery of Flight 3)</i> provides the rich, detailed backstory of Stewart&#x2019;s time as a WWII bomber pilot. He delves deep into Stewart&#x2019;s restless spirit, chronicling his family&#x2019;s legacy of war service, his rise to movie stardom, the many women in his life, and his struggles to fly and serve his country. Matzen paints a revealing picture of a man who defied bureaucratic and health obstacles to become a U.S. Army Air Force squadron commander. He depicts the excitement and horror of life in a bomber crew as Stewart commanded a series of missions over Germany, interspersing his story with those of other WWII survivors, such as radio operator Clem Leone and Gertrud Siepmann, who was a young child in Germany during Hitler&#x2019;s rise to power. He also shows that, although considered a war hero, Stewart had difficulty getting reestablished as an actor until Frank Capra cast him in <i>It&#x2019;s a Wonderful Life</i>. Military and movie buffs alike will revel in this vivid portrayal of a man who successfully straddled two worlds.&#x201d;&nbsp; &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br>&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Unlike many Hollywood stars, James Stewart (1908&#x2013;97) didn't make morale-boosting combat films during World War II; he was busy flying combat missions over Europe. Like many veterans, he preferred not to talk about his experiences when the conflict was over. One of the first major studies of the actor's risky missions over Nazi Germany, this title chronicles Stewart's improbable rise from small-town life in Indiana, PA, to his college years at Princeton, where he acquired his love for acting and befriended Henry Fonda, Joshua Logan, and Margaret Sullavan. His shy persona attracted the likes of actresses Marlene Dietrich, Olivia de Havilland, Norma Shearer, and Loretta Young. The bulk of this book covers Stewart's stay in England, his relationships with fellow crew members, who dealt daily with fear, loneliness, mud, and bitter cold. Stewart returned from Europe a changed man, reflected in his edgy, sometimes angry antihero roles in 1950s westerns and Alfred Hitchcock films. Author Matzen relies on extensive research and the cooperation of surviving crew members; however, as in his&nbsp;<i>Fireball: Carole Lombard and the Mystery of Flight 3</i>, small details and comments about the subject's thoughts must be taken on faith. VERDICT: Overall, an illuminating, recommended look at a hidden chapter in Stewart's life."&nbsp; &#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i><br><br>&#x201c;Exhaustively researched, exceptionally well written, <i>Mission: Jimmy Stewart and the Fight for Europe</i> is as informed and informative as it is thoroughly 'reader friendly' in organization and presentation. While certain to be an enduringly popular addition to community and academic library American Biography collections and a 'must' for all Jimmy Stewart fans, it should be noted for personal reading lists that <i>Mission: Jimmy Stewart and the Fight for Europe</i> is also available in a Kindle format."&nbsp; &#x2014;<i>Midwest Book Review</i><br><br>"This week's must-read books...A revealing look at the wartime service of one of America's most beloved actors."&nbsp; &#x2014;<i>New York Post</i><br><br>&#x201c;As Jimmy Stewart&#x2019;s children, we have always known that our father&#x2019;s service during the war was the most significant event of his life, although he rarely spoke of it.

These five omnibus volumes, beautifully produced and boxed, contain 7,000 pages of what has often been described as a single, continuous narrative. They are a perfect tribute for such a literary achievement, and a perfect gift for the O&#x2019;Brian enthusiast.</p><p>Patrick O&#39;Brian&#39;s acclaimed Aubrey/Maturin series of historical novels has been described as &#34;a masterpiece&#34; (David Mamet, New York Times), &#34;addictively readable&#34; (Patrick T. Reardon, Chicago Tribune), and &#34;the best historical novels ever written&#34; (Richard Snow, New York Times Book Review), which &#34;should have been on those lists of the greatest novels of the 20th century&#34; (George Will).Set in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars, O&#39;Brian&#39;s twenty-volume series centers on the enduring friendship between naval officer Jack Aubrey and physician (and spy) Stephen Maturin. The Far Side of the World, the tenth book in the series, was adapted into a 2003 film directed by Peter Weir and starring Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany. The film was nominated for ten Oscars, including Best Picture. The books are now available in hardcover, paperback, and e-book format.In addition to the Aubrey/Maturin novels, Patrick O&#39;Brian wrote several books including the novels Testimonies, The Golden Ocean, and The Unknown Shore, as well as biographies of Joseph Banks and Picasso. He translated many works from French into English, among them the novels and memoirs of Simone de Beauvoir, the first volume of Jean Lacouture&#39;s biography of Charles de Gaulle, and famed fugitive Henri Cherri�re&#39;s memoir Papillon.

By all accounts, it is the definitive account of the case. It tells the story of Emmett Till, the fourteen-year-old African American boy from Chicago brutally lynched for a harmless flirtation at a country store in the Mississippi Delta. Anderson utilizes documents that had never been available to previous researchers, such as the trial transcript, long-hidden depositions by key players in the case, and interviews given by Carolyn Bryant to the FBI in 2004 (her first in fifty years), as well as other recently revealed FBI documents. Anderson also interviewed family members of the accused killers, most of whom agreed to talk for the first time, as well as several journalists who covered the murder trial in 1955.<br><br>Till's death and the acquittal of his killers by an all-white jury set off a firestorm of protests that reverberated all over the world and spurred on the civil rights movement. Like no other event in modern history, the death of Emmett Till provoked people all over the United States to seek social change. Anderson's exhaustively researched book is also the basis for a Hollywood mini-series produced by Jay-Z, Will Smith, Casey Affleck, Aaron Kaplan, James Lassiter, Jay Brown, Ty Ty Smith, John P. Middleton, Rosanna Grace, David B. Clark, and Alex Foster.<br><br>For over six decades the Till story has continued to haunt the South as the lingering injustice of Till's murder and the aftermath altered many lives. Fifty years after the murder, renewed interest in the case led the Justice Department to open an investigation into identifying and possibly prosecuting accomplices of the two men originally tried. Between 2004 and 2005, the Federal Bureau of Investigation conducted the first real probe into the killing and turned up important information that had been lost for decades. Anderson covers the events that led up to this probe in great detail, as well as the investigation itself.<br><br>This book will stand as the definitive work on Emmett Till for years to come. Incorporating much new information, the book demonstrates how the Emmett Till murder exemplifies the Jim Crow South at its nadir. The author accessed a wealth of new evidence. Anderson made a dozen trips to Mississippi and Chicago over a ten-year period to conduct research and interview witnesses and reporters who covered the trial. In <i>Emmett Till</i>, Anderson corrects the historical record and presents this critical saga in its entirety.<br></p><p>Anderson grapples with the Rashomon-like quality of Till's murder through consistently careful research and thoughtful analysis. This compelling narrative will hold the attention of readers who are otherwise unfamiliar with the case, and it is likely to be the definitive work on this subject for decades to come. (David T. Beito, professor of history, University of Alabama; coauthor of Black Maverick: T. R. M. Howard's Fight for Civil Rights and Economic Power)<br><br>No one knows more about this brutal murder and its contested legacy than Devery Anderson. In his long-anticipated and meticulously researched study, he has delivered, as we all expected, the definitive account of this case. Anderson has read every source, tracked every lead, assessed every claim, and weighed every piece of evidence in his passionate quest to know the truth. This is the Emmett Till book that historians have been waiting for, and it is the book that Emmett Till's legacy deserves. (Christopher Metress, associate provost for academics, Samford University; editor of The Lynching of Emmett Till: A Documentary Narrative)<br><br>Devery S. Anderson has written the definitive account of the heinous lynching of Emmett Till in 1955, a crime that galvanized the American civil rights movement. <i>Emmett Till</i> explores the case inside and out, presenting information, evidence, and testimonies that have never been acknowledged publicly in sixty years. With over a decade of industrious research into the case, Anderson leaves no stone unturned. Thanks to him, this unforgettable book will allow readers of all generations to reflect on and learn of the true story of a fourteen-year-old youth from Chicago, murdered in Mississippi over a wolf whistle. Just when you thought you knew everything about the case, this book will unequivocally change your mind. (Ryan M. Jones, museum historian, National Civil Rights Museum at the Lorraine Motel)<br><br>You may think, as I did, that you know the totality of this tale, but you will learn much that is new, as I did. That is because Anderson has tracked down every source; read every testimony, description, and transcript; interviewed every living witness; and read the memories of the departed. He has searched every newspaper and magazine story, including the most obscure, and gathered every conflicting version. Where witnesses conflict, he offers the likeliest version and acknowledges the disagreement. He places this horrendous crime where it belongs: centrally in the civil rights movement. . . . This is a book that covers its subject magnificently. (from the foreword by Julian Bond, chairman emeritus, NAACP)Devery S.

And Taylor knows how to sin. As a small-town hero in the early '90s, he threw himself into a hard-drinking, fierce-loving, live-for-the-moment life; when his music exploded, he found himself rich, wanted, and on the road. But soon his extreme lifestyle led him to question what it means to sin and whether it could-or should-be cast in a different light. After all, if sin makes us human how wrong can it be?Now updated with a new Afterword by the author, <i>Seven Deadly Sins</i> is a brutally honest look "at a life that could have gone horribly wrong at any turn," and the soul-searching and self-discovery it took to set it right.</p><p><b>Corey Taylor</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Seven Deadly Sins</i>, <i>A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Heaven</i>, and <i>You're Making Me Hate You</i>.

I thought of all that flat space, the quintessentially American cultural dead zone they were ripping themselves out of and knew that they were very much for real.

Her father and his allies crowned her instead of the dead king&#x2019;s half-sister Mary Tudor, who quickly mustered an army, claimed her throne, and locked Jane in the Tower of London. When Jane refused to betray her Protestant faith, Mary sent her to the executioner&#x2019;s block, where Jane transformed her father&#x2019;s greedy power-grab into tragic martyrdom.<br> <br>&#x201c;Learn you to die,&#x201d; was the advice Jane wrote to her younger sister Katherine, who has no intention of dying. She intends to enjoy her beauty and her youth and fall in love. But she is heir to the insecure and infertile Queen Mary and then to her sister Queen Elizabeth, who will never allow Katherine to marry and produce a Tudor son. When Katherine&#x2019;s pregnancy betrays her secret marriage, she faces imprisonment in the Tower, only yards from her sister&#x2019;s scaffold.<br> <br>&#x201c;Farewell, my sister,&#x201d; writes Katherine to the youngest Grey sister, Mary. A beautiful dwarf, disregarded by the court, Mary keeps family secrets, especially her own, while avoiding Elizabeth&#x2019;s suspicious glare.

Neither will I. We are chosen by God and we walk in His ways, and we never swerve from them. We don&#x2019;t have to earn our place in heaven by bribing God with acts or Masses. We don&#x2019;t have to eat bread and pretend it is flesh, drink wine and call it blood. We know that is folly for the ignorant and a trap for papist fools. This knowledge is our pride and glory. We understand, as more and more do in these days: we have been saved once and for all. We have no fear, for we will never die.<br> <br>True, my father is worldly: sinfully worldly. I wish he would let me wrestle with his soul, but he laughs and says, &#x201c;Go away, Jane, and write to our friends the Swiss reformers. I owe them a letter&#x2014;you can write for me.&#x201d;<br> <br>It is wrong of him to avoid holy discourse, but this is only the sin of inattention&#x2014;I know he is heart and soul for the true religion. Also, I must remember that he is my father and I owe obedience to my father and mother&#x2014;whatever my private opinion of them. God, who sees all, will be the judge of them. And God has seen my father and forgiven him already; my father is saved through faith.<br> <br>I fear my mother will not be saved from the fires of hell, and my sister Katherine, who is three years younger than me, a child of nine years old, is almost certainly going to die and never rise again. She is unbelievably silly. If I were a superstitious fool, I would really think she is possessed; she is quite beyond hope. My baby sister, Mary, was born into original sin and cannot grow out of it. She is quite tiny. She is as pretty as a little miniature version of our sister, Katherine, tiny as a doll. My lady mother would have sent her away as a baby to be raised far from us, and spare us the shame, but my father had too much compassion for his last stunted child, and so she lives with us. She is not an idiot&#x2014;she does her lessons well, she is a clever little girl&#x2014;but she has no sense of the grace of God; she is not one of the elect like Father and me. One like her&#x2014;whose growth has been blighted by Satan&#x2014;should be particularly fervent for salvation. I suppose a five-year-old is a little young to renounce the world&#x2014;but I was studying Latin when I was four, and Our Lord was the same age as I am now when He went to the Temple and preached to the wise men. If you do not learn the ways of the Lord when you are in the cradle, when will you make a start?<br> <br>I have studied since I was a child. I am most probably the most learned young person in the whole country, raised in the reformed religion, the favorite of the great scholar and queen Kateryn Parr. I am probably the greatest young scholar in Europe, certainly the most educated girl. I don&#x2019;t consider my cousin Princess Elizabeth a true student, for many are called but few are chosen. Poor Elizabeth shows no signs of being chosen, and her studies are very worldly. She wants to be seen as clever, she wants to please her tutors and exhibit herself. Even I have to take care that I do not fall into the sin of pride, though my mother says, rudely, that my principal care should be that I do not fall into being completely ridiculous. But when I explain to her that she is in a state of sin, she takes me by the ear and threatens to beat me. I would gladly take a beating for my faith, just as the saint Anne Askew did, but I think it more pleasing to God to apologize, curtsey, and sit down at the dinner table. Besides, there is a pie of pears with burnt cream for dinner, which is my favorite.<br> <br>It really is not easy to be a shining light in Bradgate. It is a worldly house and we are a big household. It is a great building, a brick-built house as red as Hampton Court, with a gatehouse that looms as large as that palace and set among the huge forest of Charnwood. We have every right to royal magnificence. My mother is the daughter of Princess Mary, who was Queen of France, the favorite sister of King Henry VIII, so my mother is heir to the throne of England after the late king&#x2019;s children, my cousins the princesses, Mary and Elizabeth, who are heirs to their younger brother, King Edward. This makes us the most important family in England, and we never forget it. We keep a houseful of retainers, more than three hundred, to serve the five of us; we own a stable filled with beautiful horses and the parkland all around the house, and farms and villages, rivers and lakes at the very heart of England. We have our own bear for baiting, kept caged in the stables, our own bear pit, our own cock-fighting ring. Our house is one of the biggest in the Middle Lands; we have a great hall with a musicians&#x2019; gallery at one end and a royal dais at the other. The most beautiful countryside in England is ours. I have been brought up to know that all this land belongs to me, just as we belong to England.<br> <br>Of course, between my lady mother and the throne are the three royal children: Edward, the king, who is only twelve like me, and so he rules with a lord president, and then his older sisters Princess Mary and Princess Elizabeth. Sometimes people don&#x2019;t count the two princesses as heirs, since they were both named bastards and denied by their own father. They would not even be included in the royal family but for the Christian kindness of my teacher Kateryn Parr, who brought them to court and had them acknowledged. Even worse, Princess Mary (God forgive her) is a declared and open papist and heretic, and though I am bound to love her as a cousin, it is a horror to me to be in her house, where she keeps the hours of the liturgy as if she is living in a convent and not in a reformed kingdom, for all England is Protestant now under King Edward.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t speak of Princess Elizabeth. I never do. I saw more than enough of her when we both lived with Queen Kateryn and her young husband, Thomas Seymour. All I will say is that Elizabeth should be ashamed of herself and she will have to answer to God for what she did. I saw it. I was there during the chasing and the tickling and the romping with her own stepmother&#x2019;s husband. She led Thomas Seymour&#x2014;a great man&#x2014;on to imprudence and then to his death. She was guilty of lust and adultery&#x2014;in her heart if not in his bed. She is as guilty of his death as if she named him as a treasonous plotter and led him to the scaffold. She willed him to think of himself as her lover and her husband, and the two of them as heirs to the throne. She may not have said so much: she did not have to say so much. I saw how she was with him and I know what she made him do.<br> <br>But&#x2014;no&#x2014;I do not judge. I will not judge. I never judge. That is for God. I have to retain a modest thought, an averted gaze, and compassion as from one sinner to another. And I am certain that God won&#x2019;t think of her either, when she is in the fires of hell, praying too late for her unchastity, disloyalty, and ambition. God and I will pity her, and leave her to her infinite punishment.<br> <br>At any rate, since Princess Mary and Elizabeth were both declared illegitimate, and are both clearly unsuited for the throne, these half sisters to King Edward have less of a legal claim than the daughter of King Henry&#x2019;s favorite sister, Queen Mary, which is to say: my mother.<br> <br>And this is the very reason, the very reason, why it is so important that she study the reformed faith and put aside brilliant adornment. She should avoid feasts and drinking, she should dance only with the most chaste ladies of her household and not ride around the country on that great horse of hers all day, hunting whatever is in season as if she were some sort of hungry beast of the field. The great woods around our house echo with her hunting horns, the meadows are flushed for game. Dogs die in the bear pit, heifers are slaughtered outside the flesh kitchen. I am so afraid that she is lustful (the Tudors are terribly lustful), I know that she is proud (all the Tudors are born tyrants), and anyone can see that she is extravagant and loves worldly show.<br> <br>I should reprimand her, but when I say to my tutor that I am nerving myself to tell my mother that she is guilty at the very least of pride, wrath, gluttony, lust, and greed, he says nervously to me, &#x201c;Lady Jane, truly: better not,&#x201d; and I know that he is afraid of her, as is everyone&#x2014;even my father. This only goes to show that she is guilty of unwomanly ambition, as well as everything else.<br> <br>I would be as fearful as all the weakly others, but I am borne up by my faith. I really am. This is not easy if you follow the reformed faith. Courage is easy for papists&#x2014;each fool has a dozen objects to instruct and encourage him: the icons in the church, the glass in the windows, the nuns, the priest, the choir, the incense, the heady taste of wine, which they convince themselves tastes salty of blood. But all these are vanity and emptiness. I know that I am borne up by faith because I go down on my knees in a cool white chapel in silence, and then I hear the voice of God speaking to me alone, gently like a loving father. I read my Bible for myself, nobody reads it to me, and then I hear the Word of God. I pray for wisdom and when I speak I know it is in the words of the Bible. I am His handmaiden and His mouthpiece&#x2014;and that is why it is so very wrong for my mother to shout, &#x201c;For the love of God, take that long face out of here, and go hunting before I chase you out of the library myself!&#x201d;<br> <br>Very wrong. I pray that God will forgive her, as I do. But I know He will not forget the insult to me, His handmaiden; and neither will I. I take a horse from the stables but I do not go hunting. Instead, I ride with my sister Katherine, a groom following behind us. We can ride all day in any direction and never leave our lands. We canter through meadows and skirt fields where the oats are growing, green and thick; we splash through fords and let the horses drink the clear water. We are children of the royal family of England, happiest in the English countryside, blessed in our inheritance.<br> <br><br> <br>Today, for some reason, my mother is all smiles and I have been told to wear my new dress, a gown of deep red velvet, which came from London last week, with a rich black hood and sleeves, as we have honored guests for dinner. I ask our lord chamberlain who is coming, and he says it is the former lord protector, Edward Seymour the Duke of Somerset. He was in the Tower for treason and now he is released, and returning to the Privy Council. These are the dangerous times that we live in.<br> <br>&#x201c;And he&#x2019;s bringing his son,&#x201d; says the chamberlain, and he dares to wink at me, as if I am some lighthearted girl who would be foolishly excited by the news.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, how exciting!&#x201d; says my lighthearted sister Katherine.<br> <br>I give a patient sigh and say that I will be reading in my bedroom until it is time for me to dress for dinner. If I close the door between my bedroom and our privy chamber, it may be that Katherine takes the hint and stays out.<br> <br>Not so.<br> <br>Within a moment there is a tap on the linenfold-panel door, and she puts her fair head into my private room and says: &#x201c;Oh! Are you studying?&#x201d; As if I ever do anything else.<br> <br>&#x201c;Certainly, that was my intention when I closed my door.&#x201d;<br> <br>She is deaf to irony. &#x201c;What do you think the Duke of Somerset is coming here for?&#x201d; she asks, tripping into the room without any invitation. Mary trails in behind her, as if my rooms are a royal presence chamber and anyone can get past the sergeant porter if they have good enough clothes.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you bringing that disgusting monkey in here?&#x201d; I cut across her as I see him riding on her shoulder.<br> <br>She looks shocked. &#x201c;Of course I am. Mr. Nozzle goes with me everywhere. Except when I visit the poor bear. He is afraid of the poor bear.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, he can&#x2019;t come in here and spoil my papers.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He will not. He will sit on my lap. He is a very good Mr. Nozzle.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Take him out.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Take him out, I command it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t make me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I am the oldest and these are my rooms . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I am the prettiest and I am visiting you from politeness . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>We scowl at each other. She shows me his silver chain that goes around his scrawny black neck. &#x201c;Jane, please! I will hold him tight,&#x201d; she promises me.<br> <br>&#x201c;I shall hold him for you!&#x201d; Mary offers, so now I have the two of them clamoring to hold the monkey, who should not be in my rooms anyway.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, just go!&#x201d; I say irritably. &#x201c;Both of you.&#x201d;<br> <br>But instead Katherine turns and hauls Mary up into a chair where the child sits, no bigger than a doll, smiling at me with all the charm in the world.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sit straight,&#x201d; Katherine reminds her, and Mary puts back her shoulders and sits up tall.<br> <br>&#x201c;No! Just go!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I will, as soon as I have asked you this question.&#x201d; Katherine is happy because she is getting her own way as usual. She is ridiculously pretty, and about as sensible as Mr. Nozzle.<br> <br>&#x201c;Very well,&#x201d; I say sternly. &#x201c;Ask your question, and then go.&#x201d;<br> <br>She takes a breath. &#x201c;Why do you think the Duke of Somerset is coming here?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I have no idea.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because I know. So why don&#x2019;t you? I thought you were supposed to be so very, very clever?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to know,&#x201d; I say simply.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can tell you. All you know is stuff in books.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Stuff in books,&#x201d; I repeat the words of an ignorant child. &#x201c;Indeed. I do know &#x2018;stuff in books&#x2019; but if I wanted to know worldly news, I would ask my father, who would tell me the truth. I would not go round eavesdropping on my parents and listening to servants&#x2019; gossip.&#x201d;<br> <br>She jumps up on my big wooden bed as if she is planning to stay until dinnertime, and then props herself up against the pillow as if she is going to sleep here. The monkey makes himself comfortable beside her, and runs his skinny little fingers through his own silky fur.<br> <br>&#x201c;Does he have fleas?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, yes,&#x201d; she says indifferently. &#x201c;But not lice.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then get him off my bed!&#x201d;<br> <br>In reply, she gathers him onto her lap. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t fuss, because it is so exciting. They&#x2019;re coming for your betrothal!&#x201d; she announces. &#x201c;There! I thought that would make you jump.&#x201d;<br> <br>I am jumping so little that I keep one steady finger in the book to mark my place. &#x201c;And where d&#x2019;you get that from?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Everyone knows,&#x201d; she says, which means that it is servants&#x2019; gossip, as I predicted. &#x201c;Oh, you&#x2019;re so lucky! I think Ned Seymour is the most handsome young man in the world.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, but you like anything in hose.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He has such kind eyes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Certainly he has eyes, but they do not have the power of emotion, only of sight.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And a lovely smile.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I imagine that he smiles like anyone else, but I have not bothered to look.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And he rides beautifully and he has beautiful clothes and he is the son of the most powerful man in England. There is no greater family than the Seymours. No one richer. They are wealthier than us. They are even closer to the throne than us.&#x201d;<br> <br>I think, but I don&#x2019;t say, that the greatness of the family was no protection for Thomas Seymour, who was beheaded just a year ago because of Elizabeth, and not even his older brother could save him.

Conven�tional wisdom says that&#x2019;s how the world has to work. Bad jobs with low wages, minimal benefits, little training, and chaotic schedules are the only way companies can keep costs down and prices low. If companies were to offer better jobs, cus�tomers would have to pay more or companies would have to make less. <br>&nbsp; <br>But in <i>The Good Jobs Strategy</i>, Zeynep Ton, a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management, makes the compelling case that even in low-cost settings, leaving employees behind&#x2014;with bad jobs&#x2014;is a choice, not a necessity. Drawing on more than a decade of research, Ton shows how operational excellence enables companies to of�fer the lowest prices to customers while ensuring good jobs for their employees and superior results for their investors. <br>&nbsp; <br>Ton describes the elements of the good jobs strategy in a variety of successful companies around the world, including Southwest Airlines, UPS, Toyota, Zappos, and In-N-Out Burger. She focuses on four model retailers&#x2014;Costco, Merca�dona, Trader Joe&#x2019;s, and QuikTrip&#x2014;to demonstrate the good jobs strategy at work and reveals four choices that have transformed these compa�nies&#x2019; high investment in workers into lower costs, higher profits, and greater customer sat�isfaction. <br>&nbsp; <br>Full of surprising, counterintuitive insights, the book answers questions such as: How can offering fewer products increase customer sat�isfaction? Why would having more employees than you need reduce costs and boost profits? How can companies simultaneously standardize work and empower employees? <br>&nbsp; <br><i>The Good Jobs Strategy</i> outlines an invaluable blueprint for any organization that wants to pur�sue a sustainable competitive strategy in which everyone&#x2014;employees, customers, and investors&#x2014;wins. <br>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><b>ZEYNEP&nbsp;TON</b>&nbsp;has been a professor at MIT&#x2019;s Sloan School of Management&nbsp;since 2011. Previously she was on the faculty of the Harvard Business School, where she was given an award for&nbsp;excellence in teaching in 2010.</p><b>Introduction</b><b><br></b> There are different ways to make money, I tell my MBA students on the first day of the class I teach on operations for service industries. You can certainly succeed at the expense of your employees by offering bad jobs&#x2014;jobs that pay low wages, provide scant benefits and erratic work schedules, and are designed in a way that makes it hard for employees to perform well or find meaning and dignity in their work. You can even succeed at the expense of your customers; for example, by offering shoddy service. People may not enjoy buying from you, but plenty of them will do it anyway if you keep prices low enough.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In service industries, succeeding at the expense of employees and at the expense of customers often go together. If employees can&#x2019;t do their work properly, they can&#x2019;t provide good customer service. That&#x2019;s why our experiences with restaurants, airlines, hotels, hospitals, call centers, and retail stores are often disappointing, frustrating, and needlessly time-consuming.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people in the business world assume that bad jobs are necessary to keep costs down and prices low. But I give this approach a name&#x2014;the <i>bad jobs strategy</i>&#x2014;to emphasize that it is not a necessity, it is a choice. &nbsp; There are companies in business today that have made a different choice, which I call the <i>good jobs strategy.</i> These companies provide jobs with decent pay, decent benefits, and stable work schedules. But more than that, these companies design jobs so that their employees can perform well and find meaning and dignity in their work. These companies&#x2014;despite spending much more on labor than their competitors do in order to have a well-paid, well-trained, well-motivated workforce&#x2014;enjoy great success. Some are even spending all that extra money on labor <i>while competing to offer the lowest prices</i>&#x2014;and they pull it off with excellent profits and growth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point in the class, I tell my students that if they end up founding or leading a business, they will be able to choose <i>how</i> that business makes money. They can choose a &#x201c;low cost at any cost&#x201d; approach, but they cannot say they had no other choice. And finally, I tell them that if instead they choose the good jobs strategy, they had better take a lot of operations courses&#x2014;like the one they&#x2019;re in&#x2014;because operations is what makes the good jobs strategy possible.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They laugh, but they soon discover that I am not kidding. And that is what <i>The Good Jobs Strategy</i> is about&#x2014;how companies can use operations to deliver good jobs to employees, strong returns to investors, and low prices and good service to customers all at the same time.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good jobs strategy is not just a book title, it is a concrete strategy. It combines investment in people&#x2014;much more investment than normal&#x2014;with a set of operational decisions related to (a) how many products and services a company will offer, (b) the balance of job standardization and employee empowerment, (c) the allocation of work among employees, and (d) staffing levels and how employees will engage in continuous improvement. I did not invent this strategy. It is not the product of academic speculation. I observed it in a group of highly successful companies. I wanted to know how these companies managed to do very well and keep their prices low without making life miserable for employees and frustrating for customers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book tells what I found. Chapter 1 describes what the bad jobs strategy and the good jobs strategy look like when you&#x2019;re working in them and highlights the possibility and benefits of pursuing the good jobs strategy even in low-cost retail. Chapter 2 explains why operations and investment in people are the key ingredients of the good jobs strategy. Chapter 3 shows how poor operations is more of an Achilles&#x2019; heel than most retailers realize and is a natural result of trying too hard to control labor costs. This chapter introduces what I call the &#x201c;vicious cycle of retail.&#x201d; In Chapter 4, we meet the four &#x201c;model retailers&#x201d; that are the core of this book&#x2014;companies that follow the good jobs strategy, offering good jobs, low prices, and excellent customer service, and generating great financial results all at the same time. Rather than being stuck in the vicious cycle, these companies are benefiting from what I call the &#x201c;virtuous cycle of retail.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapters 5 through 8 are the practical heart of the book. They discuss in detail the four operational choices that make the difference for these model retailers. In addition to the benefits just listed&#x2014;good jobs, low prices, good service, and strong financial performance&#x2014;two further strategic benefits of the good jobs strategy are shown in Chapter 9. In Chapter 10, we look at how companies can stick with the good jobs strategy even when circumstances are pushing them hard the other way.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the strategy I will describe has been very successful, it is neither quick nor easy. In fact, it is complex and has to be carried out carefully, forcefully, continuously, and in the face of many obstacles. In return, it not only allows for better day-to-day and year-to-year performance, but it also allows companies to seize strategic opportunities by adapting to changing circumstances more quickly than other companies can manage.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good jobs strategy can be seen at work in a variety of contexts, but in this book I focus on low-cost retail for three reasons. First, retail is where millions of people work. Walmart, the eight-hundred-pound gorilla of low-cost retail, is the world&#x2019;s largest private employer, with more than 1.3 million employees in the United States alone. Second, low-cost retail jobs are notorious for their low pay, minimal benefits, unstable schedules, and lack of meaning and dignity&#x2014;the epitome of &#x201c;bad jobs&#x201d; as I define the term. Third, of the people who believe that offering good jobs is possible, most do not believe it is possible to do so in such industries as low-cost retail. If the good jobs strategy is possible in low-cost retail, then it is possible pretty much anywhere.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the context of this book is retail, the good jobs strategy allows many other types of companies to use operations to provide good jobs for employees, high quality of goods and services at low prices for customers, and strong financial returns for investors. The examples include airlines, restaurants, hotels, call centers, distribution centers, and manufacturers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wrote this book for managers, executives, and entrepreneurs who want to offer good jobs but don&#x2019;t think they can because controlling costs is so important to their business. You will see that offering good jobs can in fact reduce costs and increase profits as long as it is combined with operational excellence. If you want to offer good jobs and low prices at the same time, operational excellence is not optional, it is mandatory.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wrote this book for people who believe that offering good jobs may be good for individuals and for society, but that business decisions should be made solely to maximize profits. You will see that the companies that follow the good jobs strategy don&#x2019;t do it just to be altruistic. They have found it to be the best and most sustainable way to provide superior returns to their investors in the long term.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good jobs strategy is a long-term investment in your employees with the expectation that those well-paid, well-trained, well-motivated employees will generate even more than they cost. What makes them worth more than they cost is operational excellence. The companies examined closely in this book have all found this strategy to work. Many more companies should join them.</p><h2>The Trauma-Informed School: A Step-by-Step Implementation Guide for Administrators and School Personnel</h2><p><i>The Trauma-Informed School</i> is an all-inclusive guide designed to give school administrators of any school (elementary, middle or high school), step-by-step instructions of how to turn a school of any size into a trauma-informed school. With over 250 pages of content, this guide gives you the protocols you need along with a link to download all the documents needed for a successful implementation. <br><br> This well written and well-organized guide was developed from the vast experience of a nationally recognized retired school principal and school consultant (Jim Sporleder) and a nationally recognized trauma expert (Heather T.

The combined work of these two authors is a winning combination that will equip and empower you to become a trailblazer in the area of trauma-informed education.</p><p>Jim Sporleder<br> Jim Sporleder retired in 2014 as Principal of Lincoln High School in Walla Walla, WA. Under Jim s leadership, Lincoln High School became a Trauma Informed school, gaining national attention due to a dramatic drop in out-of-school suspensions, increased graduation rates and the number of students going on to post-secondary education. These dramatic changes at Lincoln caught the attention of Jamie Redford, who spent a year filming the documentary, Paper Tigers, which tells the Lincoln story. The documentary was released at the May 2015 Seattle International Film Festival. Ever since this premiere showing, it has received rave reviews and is being shown to overflow audiences around the country. Jim is currently working as a trauma-informed coach/consultant as well as a trainer with the Children s Resilience Initiative based in Walla Walla, Washington. His travels as a consultant, keynote speaker, presenter and trainer have taken him all over the United States. Jim is married, has three daughters and five granddaughters. In his spare time, Jim enjoys fishing, hunting, but most of all, spending time with family. <br><br> Heather T. Forbes, LCSW<br> Heather T. Forbes, LCSW, is the co-founder and owner of the Beyond Consequences Institute in Boulder, Colorado. Forbes has worked in the field of trauma and healing since 1999. She is an internationally published author on the topics of raising children with difficult and severe behaviors, the impact of trauma on the developing child, adoptive motherhood, and self-development. Coming from a family of educators, Forbes has a heart for children in the classroom and for finding ways to teach the child who seems unteachable. Her signature style is to bridge the gap between scientific research and real-life application to equip parents, educators, and therapists with practical and effective tools. Much of her experience and insight on understanding trauma, disruptive behaviors, and adoption-related issues comes from her direct mothering experience of her two adopted children and through her close mentorship of a young adult who suffered fourteen years of severe early childhood trauma.With <i>The Trauma-Informed School</i>, Jim Sporleder and Heather Forbes have written a practical, hands-on guide that is an invaluable resource for our teachers and educational support professionals.

In Lower Manhattan, on a field in Pennsylvania, and along the banks of the Potomoc, the United States suffered the single largest loss of life from an enemy attack on its soil.<br></strong></p> In November 2002 the United States Congress and President George W. Bush established by law the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, also known as the 9/11 Commission. This independent, bipartisan panel was directed to examine the facts and circumstances surrounding the September 11 attacks, identify lessons learned, and provide recommendations to safeguard against future acts of terrorism.<br><br> This volume is the authorized edition of the Commission's final report.</p><p>The result of months of intensive investigations and inquiries by a specially appointed bipartisan panel, <i>The 9/11 Commission Report</i> is one of the most important historical documents of the modern era. And while that fact alone makes it worth owning, it is also a chilling and valuable piece of nonfiction: a comprehensive and alarming look at one of the biggest intelligence failures in history and the events that led up to it. The commission traces the roots of al-Qaeda's strategies along with the emergence of the 19 hijackers and how they entered the United States and boarded airplanes. It details the missed opportunities of law enforcement officials to avert disaster. Using transcripts of cockpit voice recordings, the report describes events on board the planes along with the chaotic reaction on the ground from nearly every level of government. Going forward, the commission calls for a comprehensive overhaul of what it sees as a deeply flawed and disjointed intelligence-gathering operation. The creation of a post for a single National Security Director is recommended, along with the creation of a National Counterterrorism Center. The report finds fault with the approaches of both the Clinton and Bush administrations but, because they were a bipartisan panel and the problems described are so systemic and far-reaching, they stop short of assigning blame to any particular person or group. Credit must be given to how readable the report is. At more than 500 pages, the writing is clear and forceful and the information is made more accessible since it is fre from election politics and rancor. While the commission notes that future attacks are probably inevitable, a coordinated preventive effort along with a clear plan to respond with efficiency can offer Americans some hope in a post-9/11 world. <i>--John Moe</i>The <b>National Commission on Terrorist Attacks</b>, also known as the 9/11 Commission, was an independent, bipartisan panel chaired by Thomas H.

A native of Louisiana, he lives in Los Angeles.CHAPTER 1: Mr. Rollins<br><br>The woman stood in the far corner of the dimly lit room, hiding in shadows like a fish in gray water. She was small, round, &nbsp;and dumpy. The fringed leather jacket probably made her seem rounder, &nbsp;but she&#x2019;d never been a looker. &nbsp;She reminded &nbsp;Mr. Rollins of an overripe peach, and the peach was clearly afraid.<br> A steady rain fell from the overcast night. The dingy, one-bedroom bungalow west of Echo Park reeked of bleach and ammonia, but the windows &nbsp;were closed, the shades were &nbsp;down, and the doors were locked. A single yellow twenty-five-watt lamp provided the only light. The chemical smell gave Mr. Rollins &nbsp;a headache, but he could not open the windows. They were screwed shut.<br> Rollins wasn&#x2019;t his real name, but the man and the woman probably weren&#x2019;t using their true names, either. Amy and Charles. Amy hadn&#x2019;t &nbsp;said three words since they arrived. Charles did the talking and Charles was getting impatient.<br>&#x201c;How long does this take?&#x201d;<br> The chemist&#x2019;s answer was resentful.<br> &#x201c;Two minutes, &nbsp;dude. Relax. Science takes time.&#x201d;<br> The chemist was a juiced-up, sleeved-out rock pile hunched over the coffee table. A hiker&#x2019;s LED headlamp blazed on his forehead. He was heating the contents of a glass jar with a small torch while watching two meters &nbsp;that looked like swollen &nbsp;TV remotes. Rollins had found him cooking &nbsp;meth &nbsp;eight years ago and used him often.<br> Charles &nbsp;was a trim man in his forties with neat brown hair and the tight build of a tennis player. Mr. Rollins had made three buys off Charles in the past year, and all had gone well. This was why Mr. Rollins let him bring the woman, &nbsp;only now, seeing her, Rollins wondered why she wanted to come. She damned near pissed herself when Rol- lins searched her and made them put on the gloves. He made everyone who entered the house wear vinyl gloves. Rollins did not allow food or drinks. No one could chew gum or smoke cigarettes. The list was pretty long. Mr. Rollins had rules.<br> He smiled as he adjusted &nbsp;his gloves.<br> &#x201c;They make your hands sweat, don&#x2019;t they, Amy? I know it&#x2019;s a pain, but we&#x2019;re almost finished.&#x201d;<br> Charles answered for her.<br> &#x201c;She&#x2019;s fine. Tell your man to finish up so we can get out of here.&#x201d; The chemist mumbled without looking up.<br> &#x201c;Fuck off.&#x201d;<br> Rollins smiled at Amy again and glanced at the round plastic container beside the chemist. It was filled with a material that looked like yogurt and felt like modeling clay.<br> &#x201c;Where&#x2019;d you get this?&#x201d;<br> Charles stepped on her answer again. &#x201c;I told you where we got it.&#x201d;<br> Rollins considered pushing his pistol up Charles&#x2019;s ass and popping a cap, but he did not let his feelings show.<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just making conversation. Amy seems nervous.&#x201d; Charles glanced at Amy.<br> &#x201c;She&#x2019;s fine.&#x201d;<br> Amy&#x2019;s voice was whisper-soft when she finally &nbsp;spoke. &#x201c;I made it.&#x201d;<br> The chemist snorted. &#x201c;Yeah. Right.&#x201d;<br> Then the chemist sat up and gazed at Rollins.<br> &#x201c;Whoever made it did a righteous job. It&#x2019;s the real deal, brother.&#x201d; Charles crossed his arms. Smug.<br> &#x201c;You see?&#x201d;<br> Rollins was impressed. The material in the Tupperware was not easy to come by. Charles claimed the woman had two hundred kilo- grams.<br> &#x201c;What about tags?&#x201d;<br> The chemist turned off the torch and unplugged the meters. &#x201c;Ethylene test shows zero. I&#x2019;ll know parts per million when I run&nbsp;a sample at home, but the stuff is clean, bro. No tags. Untraceable.&#x201d; Rollins thanked the chemist, who packed his equipment into a&nbsp;green backpack and let himself out through the kitchen. A light win- ter shower pattered the roof.<br> Charles said, &#x201c;So now what? Are we in business?&#x201d; Rollins &nbsp;sealed the lid on the Tupperware.<br> &#x201c;The buyer will test it himself. If his results are the same, we&#x2019;re golden.&#x201d;<br> Amy spoke again and this time she sounded anxious.<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll make more for the right buyer. I can make all they want.&#x201d; Charles took her arm, trying to turn her away.<br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see their money first.&#x201d; Amy did not move.<br> &#x201c;I have to meet them, you know. That&#x2019;s a requirement.&#x201d; &#x201c;Not now.&#x201d;<br> Charles steered her toward the front door like a shopping &nbsp;cart. Rollins quickly stopped them.<br> &#x201c;Back door, Charles. Never the front.&#x201d;<br> Charles swung &nbsp;the woman around and aimed her toward &nbsp;the kitchen. After insisting she come, Charles couldn&#x2019;t get her out of the house fast enough.<br> Rollins opened the back door and asked for their gloves. He gave&nbsp;Amy a gentle smile.<br> &#x201c;Buyers don&#x2019;t like to be met, but they&#x2019;ll make an exception for you, Amy. I promise.&#x201d;<br> She seemed ready to cry, but Charles pulled her out and they dis- appeared into the rain.<br> Rollins locked the kitchen door and hurried &nbsp;to the front door, where he peered through &nbsp;a peephole. When Charles and Amy reached the street, he returned to the kitchen and opened the back door to air the place out. The tiny backyard was dark and hidden from neighbors by overgrown bushes and a sprawling &nbsp;avocado tree.<br> Rollins stood in the door breathing air that didn&#x2019;t stink of ammo- nia and called his buyer.<br> &#x201c;Good news.&#x201d;<br> A coded way of saying the tests were positive. &#x201c;Very good. I will send someone.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Tonight.&#x201d; &#x201c;Yes. Now.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You have the other things here, too. I&#x2019;ve told you for a week to come get this stuff.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I am sending someone.&#x201d; &#x201c;I want it gone. All of it.&#x201d; &#x201c;He will take it.&#x201d;<br> Rollins put the Tupperware in the bedroom with the other things and returned to the kitchen. He still wore his gloves and would wear them until he left. He took a one-liter spray bottle from beneath the sink and sprayed bleach on the kitchen counters and floor and door. He sprayed the coffee table where the chemist had done his work and the stool on which the chemist had sat. He sprayed the living room floor and the doorjamb between the kitchen and living room. Rollins believed the bleach would destroy the enzymes and oils left in fingerprints or spit and erase DNA evidence. He wasn&#x2019;t convinced this was true, but it seemed sensible, so he bleached out the house whenever he used it.<br> When Mr. Rollins acquired the house, he made several changes to better serve his needs, like screwing shut the windows and installing peepholes. Nothing &nbsp;fancy, nothing &nbsp;expensive, and nothing &nbsp;to attract the neighbors&#x2019; attention, none of whom knew him, had met him or, hopefully, seen him. &nbsp;Rollins did only enough maintenance &nbsp;to prevent the house from becoming an eyesore. He let people stay from time to time, never anyone he personally knew and only long enough so the neighbors would think the house was a rental. &nbsp;Mr. Rollins had not built a fortress when he acquired the house, just a place of relative safety from which to do his crime.<br> Rollins put away the bleach, returned &nbsp;to the living room, and turned off the lamp. He sat in the darkness, nose burning &nbsp;as he lis- tened to the rain.<br> 9:42 p.m.<br> 2142 hours.<br> 1742 Zulu Time.<br> Mr. Rollins hated to wait, but there was big money at stake if Charles and Amy were real. Rollins wondered if Charles beat her. He seemed like the type. &nbsp;She seemed like the type, too. Rollins&#x2019;s older sister married &nbsp;a man who abused her for years until &nbsp;Rollins &nbsp;killed &nbsp;him.<br> Rollins checked the time again.<br> 9:51.<br> Rollins put his pistol on the couch. He rested his hand on the gun, checked the time, and closed his eyes.<br> 9:53.<br> The rain stopped.<br> 10:14.<br> Someone knocked at the front door.<br> Rollins jerked to his feet and moved quickly into the kitchen. The buyer&#x2019;s man would &nbsp;never use the front door. That was a rule. Every- one used the back.<br> Rollins quietly &nbsp;closed and locked the kitchen door as knocking came from the front.<br> Knock knock knock.<br> Rollins slipped off his shoes and hurried &nbsp;to the front. Knock knock knock.<br> Mr. Rollins peered through &nbsp;the peephole and saw an adult male in a dark rain shell. The hood was back and the unzipped shell exposed a loud patterned shirt. Average height, Anglo, dark hair. The man pressed the bell, but the bell didn&#x2019;t work, so he knocked again.<br> Rollins &nbsp;held his pistol &nbsp;close as he watched.<br> The man waited a few seconds and finally &nbsp;walked&nbsp; away.<br> Rollins watched for another two minutes. Cars passed and a cou- ple went by huddled beneath an umbrella even though &nbsp;the rain no longer fell. The world appeared normal, &nbsp;but a siren wailed in the dis- tance. Rollins had a bad feeling.<br>10:32.<br> Rollins phoned the buyer again.<br> &#x201c;The person you sent, he knows to go to the back?&#x201d; &#x201c;Yes. Of course. He has been there before.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;If you sent someone, he didn&#x2019;t show.&#x201d; &#x201c;Hold on. I will find out.&#x201d;<br> A second siren was screaming. Closer. The man&#x2019;s voice returned.<br> &#x201c;He should have been there. This is not right.&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m jammed up here, man. I want to leave.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Bring the material to me. Not here. Someone will meet you by<br> MacArthur Park, there on the northeast corner.&#x201d;<br> Rollins felt a flash of anger, but kept his voice cool. Rollins had made a fortune &nbsp;off this man and stood to make more.<br> &#x201c;You know the rules, Eli. I&#x2019;m not driving around with your things in my car. Come get this crap.&#x201d;<br> Rollins was pocketing his phone when he heard a wet crunch in the yard and pounding on the back door.<br> Rollins hurried to the kitchen,&nbsp; checked the peephole, and saw a face he recognized. Carlos, Caesar, something &nbsp;like that. His eyes were bright and he was breathing hard when Rollins opened the door.<br> Rollins scratched gloves from his pocket. &#x201c;Put on the gloves, you idiot.&#x201d;<br> Carlos ignored the gloves and ran to the living room, trailing mud and grass. He peeked out the nearest window, &nbsp;bare fingers touching the shade. A helicopter passed overhead &nbsp;so low the little house shook. &#x201c;Fuck your gloves. You hear that? The police are on me, bro. Ain&#x2019;t<br> this fuckin&#x2019; cool? I smoked their blue ass!&#x201d;<br> The helicopter rumbled away, but circled the area.<br> Rollins felt a burst &nbsp;of fear. Thoughts of mud, grass, and fingerprints on the shade vanished. He touched &nbsp;aside the shade and saw a blazing searchlight sweep the next street.<br> &#x201c;You brought the police.&#x201d; Carlos turned away, laughing.<br> &#x201c;I lost them, bro. I could be anywhere.&#x201d;<br> Rollins felt as if his head were filling with angry maggots. The helicopter orbited overhead, lighting up the shades. The chop of the rotor moved away and slowly circled.<br> &#x201c;How the fuck did this happen?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;They made my face. I got warrants, y&#x2019;know? Relax.&#x201d;<br> Carlos flopped onto the couch, giggling, wired on adrenaline and chemicals. His muddy &nbsp;shoes were on the cushions.<br> &#x201c;They don&#x2019;t know where I am. They gonna roll over us and keep right on rollin&#x2019;.&#x201d;<br> Rollins &nbsp;gathered his thoughts. The house &nbsp;was now lost. The goods in the bedroom were history. The mud and the grass no longer mattered. Rollins could not allow himself to be found here with the material in the bedroom and this giggling idiot on the couch. Rollins accepted these facts and the acceptance brought &nbsp;calm.<br> The pistol was no good to him now. Rollins returned to the cabi- net where he kept the bleach and took out a rusted, &nbsp;fourteen-inch pipe wrench. The wrench easily weighed three or four pounds.<br> Carlos was still stretched on the couch when Mr. Rollins went back to the living room. He strode directly to Carlos without &nbsp;saying a word and brought the wrench down hard. He felt the head go on the first blow, but gave it two more. Rollins dropped the wrench and put on a fresh &nbsp;pair of gloves. He pressed the pistol into Carlos&#x2019;s hands, both hands so it would look like Carlos had handled the gun, and dropped it beside the wrench. If Rollins was picked up, he did not want a gun in his possession.<br>The helicopter &nbsp;passed again. The shades flashed &nbsp;into blinding white rectangles and once more filled with black.<br> Rollins trotted to the front door and looked through the peep- hole. A police officer &nbsp;passed on the sidewalk &nbsp;and another &nbsp;spoke with people across the street. Rollins &nbsp;closed his eyes. He took slow, mea- sured &nbsp;breaths &nbsp;as he counted to one hundred. He put his eye to the peephole again. The policemen were gone.<br> Rollins returned to the kitchen. He wore a dark sport coat and slacks. There would be blood splatter, but the blood would be difficult to see at night on the dark fabric. He had a nylon rain shell, but de- cided not to put it on. The sport coat was better. The police were looking for a young Latin guy in a black T-shirt, &nbsp;not an older, well- dressed Anglo. &nbsp;His car was several blocks away. If Rollins could get away from the house and beyond the police perimeter, he still might survive.<br> The light returned and slid away again.<br> Rollins moved in the moment of darkness. He opened the kitchen door, peeled off his gloves, and stepped out. A cop and a German shepherd were in the backyard. The dog was a deep-chested brute with angry eyes and fangs like daggers. The cop shouted as the dog charged.</p><h2>Save Me from Myself: How I Found God, Quit Korn, Kicked Drugs, and Lived to Tell My Story</h2><p><p>The incredible story of a controversial rock star, his secret addiction to methamphetamines, and his miraculous salvation through Jesus Christ. Candid and inspiring, <em>Save Me from Myself</em> is a rock 'n' roll journey unlike any other.</p></p><p><p>Brian "Head" Welch was one of the founding members of Korn. In 2005, after an intense spiritual awakening, he was instantly delivered from years of substance abuse with almost no symptoms of withdrawal. Today he lives and prays with his daughter Jennea in Arizona.</p>Welch starts his memoir with a bang: sex, drugs, rock &#x2018;n roll, and hitting bottom are all packed into his short prologue, launching the story of the rock star&#x2019;s rise, fall, and subsequent conversion to Christianity. Unfortunately, Welch, the former lead guitarist of the hardcore metal band Korn, never quite gets back to the punchy, dramatic style that so vividly sets in motion what could be a fascinating read, but at times is more like a casual chronology of events&#x2014;despite his willingness to curse and his rocker tone. The book&#x2019;s first section is a catalogue of teenage rebellion (tormenting his brother, watching horror flicks, smoking pot), yet somehow lacks drama, and Welch can&#x2019;t resist listing every single band he formed, played with, and left before finally making it with Korn. It&#x2019;s not until Welch tells of a visionary experience &#x2014;one that eventually leads him to Jesus&#x2014;that this story gains momentum as a spiritual memoir. Fans of Noah Levine (Dharma Punx) may enjoy Welch&#x2019;s hard-core tone, though be warned: Welch is now hard-core on Jesus, and he hopes this story "might save a lot of people from going down the roads of destruction that [he] traveled on."</p><h2>Soup: The Ultimate Book of Soups and Stews (Soup Recipes, Comfort Food Cookbook, Homemade Meals, Gifts for Foodies)</h2><p><b>&#x201c;With Chef Derek Bissonnette in your kitchen you have casual, approachable, and electric cooking.&nbsp;<i>Soups</i>&nbsp;will bring pure joy, warmth, and flavor to the table, and the beautiful photography will transport you to a dream workplace.&#x201d; &#x2013; Daniel Boulud, Chef/Owner of The Dinex</b><br><br>Go way beyond the basics with this gorgeous chef&#x2019;s compendium of delicious, satisfying soups and stews!&nbsp;Snap out of your same old soup and stew recipe routine with hundreds of new and exciting takes on the classics&#x2014;and some creative concoctions that will surely become family favorites.<br> Inspired by both his home state of Maine and global cuisines, Chef Derek Bissonnette&#x2019;s <i>Soup</i> features:<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- <b>300+ Easy-to-Follow Recipes</b> that will guide you to remarkable results&nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- <b>Mouth-Watering Photography</b> and detailed illustrations that walk you through culinary tools and techniques&nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- <b>Recipes for all Palates</b> &#x2013; it doesn&#x2019;t matter if you&#x2019;re an omnivore, gluten-free, vegetarian, or vegan<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- <b>Family-Friendly Recipes</b> designed to be ready in 30 minutes or less<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- <b>20+ Chilled and Dessert Soups</b><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- <b>A Comprehensive&nbsp;History of Soup&nbsp;</b><br> Whether you are planning a casual family dinner, or a formal dinner for 20&#x2014;this cookbook will help elevate your meal from &#x201c;Ho, hum,&#x201d; to &#x201c;HEY NOW!&#x201d;</p><p>Derek Bissonnette has been a chef for the past 22 years, and is the former Executive Chef at the White Barn Inn in Kennebunk, Maine.

When Prophecy Fails [1956] is a classic text in social psychology authored by Leon Festinger, Henry Riecken, and Stanley Schachter. It chronicles the experience of a UFO cult that believed the end of the world was at hand. In effect, it is a social and psychological study of a modern group that predicted the destruction of the world, and the adjustments made when the prediction failed to materialize. &#34;The authors have done something as laudable as it is unusual for social psychologists. They espied a fleeting social movement important to a line of research they were interested in and took after it. They recruited a team of observers, joined the movement, and watched it from within under great difficulties until its crisis came and went. Their report is of interest as much for the method as for the substance.&#34;-Everett C.

In her first book, Sarah Christmyer&#x2014;codeveloper of <i>The Great Adventure</i> Catholic Bible study program&#x2014;pairs the stories of key Old Testament women with stories of women she has known to show us how we can hear God, say yes to his call, and share him with the world just as they did.</p><p>Breaking open the scriptures to reveal the historical, cultural, and biblical context in which Old Testament women lived, Sarah Christmyer breathes new life into their stories and makes their lives surprisingly relatable. In the process, she shares stories from her own faith journey and the lives of family and friends to show how the same principles that turned ordinary women into heroines of the faith are true for our lives today.</p><p>Each chapter of <i>Becoming Women of the Word</i> highlights the spiritual legacy of one or more women in the Old Testament. Their world was vastly different from ours, yet they faced the same questions we do: when we can&#x2019;t feel God&#x2019;s presence, where do we find help? When our world is collapsing, where is God? Why should we trust him? <i>How</i> can we trust him? Christmyer simply and clearly draws from the lives of these women important principles that help us to trust&#x2014;even as we struggle with doubt. For example:</p><ul><li>Through Eve, we learn to hold on to God&#x2019;s promise even when we fail.</li><li>Sarah reminds us to wait on God&#x2019;s timing to make us fruitful.</li><li>Miriam, the sister of Moses, shows how to lead by example.</li><li>Ruth and Esther challenge us to see womanhood as a gift.</li><li>Hannah and Judith inspire us to trust God even in matters of life and death.</li></ul><p>These unforgettable portraits create a colorful mosaic of faith, encouraging us to mine God&#x2019;s Word for spiritual treasure and to pass on the gift.</p></p><p><b>Sarah Christmyer</b> is a Catholic author, speaker, and adjunct faculty member at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

You as a leader may have it, but has your organization caught it? If a leader&#39;s vision is all about what could be and what should be, why are you buried under what is? Noted author and pastor Andy Stanley points out that if followers don&#39;t get the vision, it&#39;s because the leaders haven&#39;t delivered it. He reveals the three reasons vision doesn&#39;t stick. And then he delivers three ways to make vision stick, to make you a leader worth following:1. Cast vision strategically: defining your vision.2. Celebrate vision systematically: regularly rejoicing in the successes3.

Gone. They've survived hunger. They've survived lies. But the stakes keep rising, and the dystopian horror keeps building in <em>Plague</em>, Michael Grant's fourth book in the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling Gone series.</p><p>A highly contagious fatal illness is spreading at an alarming rate, while sinister, predatory insects terrorize Perdido Beach. Sam, Astrid, Diana, and Caine are plagued by a growing doubt that they'll escape&#x2014;or even survive&#x2014;life in the FAYZ. With so much turmoil surrounding them, what desperate choices will they make when it comes to saving themselves and those they love?</p></p><p><p>Michael Grant, author of the Gone series, the Messenger of Fear series, the Magnificent Twelve series, and the Front Lines trilogy, has spent much of his life on the move. Raised in a military family, he attended ten schools in five states, as well as three schools in France. Even as an adult he kept moving, and in fact he became a writer in part because it was one of the few jobs that wouldn&#x2019;t tie him down. His fondest dream is to spend a year circumnavigating the globe and visiting every continent. Yes, even Antarctica. He lives in California with his wife, Katherine Applegate, with whom he cowrote the wildly popular Animorphs series.&nbsp;You can visit him online at www.themichaelgrant.com&nbsp;and follow him on Twitter @MichaelGrantBks.</p>Though the desperate, dirty, starving teens of the Gone series look decreasingly like the clean-cut hotties on the book jackets, Grant&#x2019;s sf-fantasy thrillers continue to be the very definition of page-turner. Nearly out of water and beset with two types of plagues (one like a flu, the other a horde of flesh-eating bugs), the FAYZ community of superfriends and superenemies must once again band together and fight. Being dumped into this populous soap opera, with all its powers and vendettas, will doom newcomers. But who&#x2019;d be crazy enough to start here? Great fun for fans.

A convert to Catholicism, he had a profound impact on the thought and life of the Church in the twentieth century.<p>"The author is true to his title.

He traces the storyline of the scriptures from the standpoint of biblical theology, examining the overarching message that is conveyed throughout. Schreiner emphasizes three interrelated and unified themes that stand out in the biblical narrative: God as Lord, human beings as those who are made in God&#39;s image, and the land or place in which God&#39;s rule is exercised. The goal of God&#39;s kingdom is to see the king in his beauty and to be enraptured in his glory.</p><p>"A wonderfully clear and faithful account of biblical theology. This book is both intellectually compelling and honoring to God and so deserves to be widely read."<br>--<b>Simon Gathercole</b>, University of Cambridge<br><br>"From the garden of Eden to the garden of Paradise, Tom Schreiner deftly takes the reader through the entire narrative of the history of redemption. Giving attention to every part of the canonical Scriptures, Schreiner shows how the Bible coheres under the theme of the kingdom or rule of God. The payoff is a feast of theological, practical, and devotional insights. In a simple, direct, and nontechnical way, this book will bring Christians to a new understanding and appreciation of the entire Bible."<br>--<b>Donald A. Hagner</b>, Fuller Theological Seminary<br><br>"Schreiner's one-volume biblical theology is a bountiful bonanza of biblical storytelling. In a time when biblical studies has become partitioned between the Hebrew Bible and the Greek New Testament, Schreiner reminds us that there is one God, one book, and one story. A nuanced and much-needed book to help Christians understand what the Bible is about and how it all hangs together."<br>--<b>Michael F. Bird</b>, Crossway College, Brisbane, Australia<br><br>"Having written major volumes on Pauline theology and New Testament theology, Tom Schreiner places a remarkable capstone on his work by tackling a biblical theology of the entire canon of Scripture. And he is up to the task, clearly and consistently tracing the theme of God as King and the ultimate triumph of the kingdom of God from Genesis through Revelation. Few volumes have dealt so comprehensively and so well with the grand narrative of Scripture from beginning to end."<br>--<b>Mark L. Strauss</b>, Bethel Seminary San Diego<br><br>"A book that wonderfully unites all the books of the Bible. Few authors have the command of learning, the gift of teaching, and the heart for God that this volume reflects. Digest this book to elevate your grasp of the Bible and to find your soul riveted like never before to the King in his beauty."<br>--<b>Robert W. Yarbrough</b>, Covenant Theological Seminary, St. Louis, Missouri<b>Thomas R.

Celebrated for his electrifying readings, he taught at San Diego State, San Diego City College, UC San Diego, and the College of Southern Idaho. He edited the anthology The Maverick Poets, translated a volume of Pablo Neruda&#x2019;s political poetry, wrote two collections inspired by the love poetry of India, and published eight other volumes of poetry. His work appeared in numerous anthologies and magazines. Steve described himself as a &#x201c;poet, essayist, teacher, workshop facilitator, and all-around no good troublemaker.&#x201d; Recently retired from Southwestern College in Chula Vista but still holding poetry workshops in San Diego, he died in his sleep in 2015 at home with his wife, Mary, in Potrero, CA, just days before his latest volume of poetry was published by Tampa University Press.&#x201c;Kowit really delivers what his title promises, so that reading the book is like taking a workshop with a generous poet willing to share everything he has learned about the creative process and the craft of poetry. Conversational in tone, it reads rather like an informal lecture. Kowit covers a lot of technical material on metrical variations and line breaks and sound, and he balances it by attending to the sources of poetry in dream and emotion, in longing and loss. Although likely to find its largest audience among aspiring poets, Kowit's effort is substantial enough to be of use to more practiced poets and to poetry readers, too.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Patricia Monaghan, <em>Booklist</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;My absolute favorite book for teaching poetry&#x2015;wonderful exercises, great writing prompts, and a generous selection of relevant contemporary poems&#x2015;all held together by Kowit&#x2019;s conversational tone that speaks to us like a good friend inviting us into the wonders of poetry.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Riochard Blanco</strong><br><br>&#x201c;This book will excite your imagination.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Writers Ink</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;It will help you unlock your heart and transform what's inside into memorable poetry.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Writer's Digest Book Club</em></strong></p><h2>Erased, Vol. 2 (Erased, 2)</h2><p>After his mother&#39;s death triggers his Revival ability, Satoru finds himself 18 years in the past!

At this stage, you are forming the DNA of your startup, and this genetic code is permanent. By paying attention to a few important issues, you can build the right foundation and free yourself to concentrate on the big challenges. This chapter explains how to start a startup.</p><p>Answer Simple Questions</p><p>There is a myth that successful companies begin with grandiose ambitions. The implication is that entrepreneurs should start with megalomaniacal goals in order to succeed. To the contrary, my observation is that great companies began by asking simple questions:</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>THEREFORE, WHAT?</b>* This question arises when you spot or predict a trend and wonder about its consequences. It works like this: &#x201c;Everyone will have a smartphone with a camera and Internet access.&#x201d; Therefore, what? &#x201c;They will be able to take pictures and share them.&#x201d; Therefore, what? &#x201c;We should create an app that lets people upload their photos, rate the photos of others, and post comments.&#x201d; And, voila, there&#x2019;s Instagram.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>ISN&#x2019;T THIS INTERESTING? </b>Intellectual curiosity and accidental discovery power this method. Spencer Silver was trying to make glue but created a substance that barely holds paper together. This oddity led to Post-it Notes. Ray Kroc was an appliance salesman who noticed that a small restaurant in the middle of nowhere ordered eight mixers. He visited the restaurant out of curiosity, and it impressed him with its success. He pitched the idea of similar restaurants to Dick and Mac McDonald, and the rest is history.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>IS THERE A BETTER WAY?</b> Frustration with the current state of the art is the hallmark of this path. Ferdinand Porsche once said, &#x201c;In the beginning I looked around and, not finding the automobile of my dreams, decided to build it myself.&#x201d;* Steve Wozniak built the Apple I because he believed there was a better way to access computers than having to work for the government, a university, or a large company. Larry Page and Sergey Brin thought measuring inbound links was a better way to prioritize search results and started Google.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>WHY DOESN&#x2019;T OUR COMPANY DO THIS? </b>Frustration with your current employer is the catalyzing force in this case. You&#x2019;re familiar with the customers in a market and their needs. You tell your management that the company should create a product because customers need it, but management doesn&#x2019;t listen to you. Finally, you give up and do it yourself.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>IT&#x2019;S POSSIBLE, SO WHY DON&#x2019;T WE MAKE IT? </b>Markets for big innovations are seldom proven in advance, so a what-the-hell attitude characterizes this path. For example, back in the 1970s a portable phone was incomprehensible to most people when Motorola invented it. At the time, phones were linked to places, not people. However, Martin Cooper and the engineers at Motorola went ahead and made it, and the rest is history. Don&#x2019;t let anyone tell you that the &#x201c;If we build it, they will come&#x201d; theory doesn&#x2019;t work.<br><p></p><p>&#x201c;The genesis of great companies is answering simple questions that change the world, not the desire to become rich.&#x201d;</p><p></p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>WHERE IS THE MARKET LEADER WEAK? </b>Three conditions make a market leader vulnerable: First, when the leader is committed to a way of doing business. For example, IBM distributed computers through resellers, so Dell could innovate by selling direct. Second, when the customers of the leader are dissatisfied. For example, the necessity to drive to Blockbuster stores to pick up and return videos opened the door for Netflix. Third, when the market leader is milking a cash cow and stops innovating. This is what made Microsoft Office susceptible to Google Docs.<br><p>&#x201c;How can we make a boatload of money?&#x201d; is not one of the questions. Call me idealistic, but the genesis of great companies is answering simple questions that change the world, not the desire to become rich.</p><p></p><p>EXERCISE</p><p>Complete this sentence: If your startup never existed, the world would be worse off because __________.</p><p></p><p>Find Your Sweet Spot</p><p>If you have the answer to a simple question, the next step is to find a viable sweet spot in the market. Mark Coopersmith, coauthor of <i>The Other &#x201c;F&#x201d; Word: Failure&#x2014;Wise Lessons for Breakthrough Innovation and Growth</i>, and senior fellow at the Haas School of Business, helps entrepreneurs do this by using a Venn diagram with three factors:</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>EXPERTISE</b>. This is the sum total of what you and your founders can do. Though you won&#x2019;t yet have a complete team, you must have a core of fundamental knowledge and ability to create something in order for a startup to start up.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>OPPORTUNITY</b>. There are two kinds of opportunities: an existing market and a potential one. Either is okay, but do a reality check of the size of the market in the next few years. There&#x2019;s a reason people rob banks, not thrift stores. There are times, however, when there&#x2019;s no way to prove that an opportunity exists and you just have to believe.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>PASSION</b>. This one is tricky because it&#x2019;s not clear whether passion causes success or success causes passion. Everyone assumes the former is true, but let&#x2019;s be honest: it&#x2019;s easy to get excited about a business that takes off, so the latter may be true too. Still, success may take a long time, so you&#x2019;d better at least not hate what you&#x2019;re doing.<br><p>Don&#x2019;t get the impression that all three factors are necessary or even obvious at the start. If you have at least two of the factors, you can often develop the third if you try hard enough.</p><p>Find Soul Mates</p><p>The next step is to find some soul mates to go on your adventure&#x2014;think Bilbo Baggins in <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i>. However, people love the notion of the sole innovator: Thomas Edison (lightbulb), Steve Jobs (Macintosh), Henry Ford (Model T), Anita Roddick (The Body Shop), and Richard Branson (Virgin Airlines). It&#x2019;s wrong.</p><p>Successful companies are usually started, and become successful, with the contributions of at least two soul mates. After the fact, people may recognize one founder as the innovator, but it takes a team to make a new venture work.</p><p></p><p>&#x201c;The first follower is what transforms the lone nut into a leader.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p>To illustrate this concept, Derek Sivers, the founder of CD Baby, showed a video at the TED2010 conference that starts with one person dancing alone in a field. A second person joins in, and then a third, and the crowd &#x201c;tips&#x201d; into a full-scale dance festival.</p><p>According to Sivers, the first follower plays an important role because he brings credibility to the leader. Subsequent followers emulate the first follower, not only the leader. In his words, &#x201c;The first follower is what transforms the lone nut into a leader,&#x201d; and in a startup, that first follower is usually a cofounder.</p><p>Cofounding soul mates need to have both similarities and differences. The key desirable similarities are:</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>VISION</b>. Although this has become an overused word uttered by wannabe visionaries, in the context of soul mates, it means that founders share a similar intuition for how the startup and market will evolve. For example, if one founder believes that computers will remain a business tool for large organizations, and the other believes the future is small, cheap, and easy-to-use personal computers for everyone, they aren&#x2019;t a good match.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>SIZE</b>. Not everyone wants to build an empire. Not everyone wants a lifestyle business. There aren&#x2019;t right and wrong expectations; there are only expectations that match or don&#x2019;t match. This doesn&#x2019;t mean founders can know what they want at the start, but it&#x2019;s nice if they&#x2019;re at least on the same page.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>COMMITMENT</b>. Founders should share the same level of commitment. Does the startup, family, or a balanced life come first? It&#x2019;s hard to make a startup work when the founders have different priorities. One founder wanting to work for two years and flipping the startup for a quick sale and the other wanting to create a company that will endure for decades will create problems. Ideally, founders agree that they&#x2019;re in it for at least ten years.<br><p>The differences that are desirable include:</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>EXPERTISE</b>. At a minimum, a startup needs at least one person to make the product (Steve Wozniak) and one person to sell it (Steve Jobs). Founders need to complement each other to build a great organization.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>ORIENTATION</b>. Some people like to sweat the details. Others like to ignore the details and worry about the big issues. A successful startup needs both types of founders to succeed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>PERSPECTIVE</b>. The more perspectives, the merrier. These can include young versus old, rich versus poor, male versus female, urban versus country, engineering versus sales, techie versus touchy, Muslim versus Christian, and straight versus gay.<br><p>Finally, a few words of wisdom about cofounders:</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>DO NOT RUSH</b>. Founders may have to work together for decades, so add them like you would pick a spouse&#x2014;assuming you&#x2019;re not a serial divorcee. It&#x2019;s better to have too few founders than too many. Breaking up with founders, like spouses, is hard to do.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>DO NOT ADD FOUNDERS TO ENHANCE FUNDABILITY</b>. The reason to bring in additional founders&#x2014;and any other employee but especially founders&#x2014;is to make your startup stronger and more likely to succeed.

Translated into sixteen languages, it has inspired anti-coup precautions by regimes around the world. In addition to these detailed instructions, Edward Luttwak&#x2019;s revised handbook offers an altogether new way of looking at political power&#x2015;one that considers, for example, the vulnerability to coups of even the most stable democracies in the event of prolonged economic distress.</p><p>The world has changed dramatically in the past half century, but not the essence of the coup d&#x2019;�tat. It still requires the secret recruitment of military officers who command the loyalty of units well placed to seize important headquarters and key hubs in the capital city. The support of the armed forces as a whole is needed only in the aftermath, to avoid countercoups. And mass support is largely irrelevant, although passive acceptance is essential. To ensure it, violence must be kept to a minimum. The ideal coup is swift and bloodless. Very violent coups rarely succeed, and if they trigger a bloody civil war they fail utterly.</p><p>Luttwak identifies conditions that make countries vulnerable to a coup, and he outlines the necessary stages of planning, from recruitment of coconspirators to postcoup promises of progress and stability. But much more broadly, his investigation of coups&#x2015;updated for the twenty-first century&#x2015;uncovers important truths about the nature of political power.</p></p><p>How can a small group of determined people overthrow a country&#39;s government and seize control of the state. This book, a practical guide to the coup d&#39;;etat analyzes the political, military and intelligence techniques which provide the answer. It begins by isolating the historical and socio-economic conditions which make the coup possible and goes on, using charts, diagrams amd tables, to describe: The classification of the armed forces; police and other security agencies in terms of intervention capability; The infiltration of the system of state security and the subversion of its crucial components; The selection of the physical facilities which must be seized or neutralized and the identification of the political personalities to be isolated; The organization and operational use of active teams of the coup and their security procedures. An economic and a technical appendix covers some of the preventive and technical aspects of the problem, while the factual background is listed in the statistical appendix.Edward N. Luttwak serves or has served as a contractor for the Office of Net Assessment of the U.S. Department of Defense and for the U.S. armed forces, and as a consultant to the U.S. National Security Council, the White House Chief of Staff, and several allied governments.</p><h2>Dragon Captives (1) (The Unwanteds Quests)</h2><p>Ten years after Alex and Aaron Stowe brought peace to Quill and Artim�, their younger twin sisters journey beyond the islands in this <i>New York Times </i>bestselling first novel of a new sequel series to The Unwanteds, which <i>Kirkus Reviews </i>called &#x201c;<i>The Hunger Games </i>meets Harry Potter.&#x201d;<br><br>Identical twins Fifer and Thisbe Stowe have amazing yet uncontrollable magical abilities.

He tries to put them back on the trees, but it doesn't work. Eventually, he gets sleepy and burrows into the fallen leaves for a long nap. When he wakes up, it's spring, and there are suddenly brand-new leaves all around, welcoming him.<p>Graceful illustrations and a childlike main character offer the perfect way to talk with children about the wonder of the changing seasons.<br><br></p></p><p>David Ezra Stein is also the author and illustrator of <i>Cowboy Ned and Andy.</i> He lives in Kew Gardens, New York.<i>Starred Review.</i> Stein's (<i>Cowboy Ned and Andy</i>) pen-and-ink illustrations conjure a place readers will wish they could visit, a tiny island that pokes up out of a bay. Drawn in mossy greens and golds, the island is home to a very young bear&#x2014;so young that when the leaves start falling in the autumn, he's a little shocked: He tried to catch them and put them back on... but it was not the same. The bear doesn't despair; he grows sleepy, goes off to hibernate and wakes in the spring. This set of events is depicted in a series of panels trained on the entrance to the bear's den; the single tree above it loses its leaves, is blanketed by snow, and receives visits first by a rabbit and then by a pair of cardinals.) Eventually the bear sticks his head back out to greet the spring sunshine and spies the tiny buds on the trees. 'Welcome!' he cried. And, he thought, the leaves welcomed him. Many things contribute to the success of Stein's tale: the joyously colored panels that hang on the pages like paintings&#x2014;more intimate, somehow, than double-page spreads&#x2014;the island's eight trees and their leaves, which seem lively and animate and entirely worthy of friendship; the innocence of the bear; and Stein's willingness to let the story assume its own haiku-like shape. His autumnal pictures seem to glow, while the bear himself has the irresistible appeal of a well-loved toy.

In Stone&#x2019;s usual go for the jugular&#x201d; style, this is a no-holds-barred history of the Bush family, comprised of smug, entitled autocrats who both use and hide behind their famous name.

In this groundbreaking text, two world renowned experts present statistical methods for studying such questions. This book starts with the notion of potential outcomes, each corresponding to the outcome that would be realized if a subject were exposed to a particular treatment or regime. In this approach, causal effects are comparisons of such potential outcomes. The fundamental problem of causal inference is that we can only observe one of the potential outcomes for a particular subject. The authors discuss how randomized experiments allow us to assess causal effects and then turn to observational studies. They lay out the assumptions needed for causal inference and describe the leading analysis methods, including, matching, propensity score methods, and instrumental variables. Many detailed applications are included, with special focus on practical aspects for the empirical researcher.</p><p>Many applied research questions are fundamentally questions of causality: Is a new drug effective? Does a training program affect someone&#39;s chances of finding a job? What is the effect of a new regulation on economic activity? In this ground-breaking text, two world-renowned experts present statistical methods for studying such questions.Guido W.

As a young man he had slept untroubled through the night. But those days of innocence were many years gone.<br><br>They were two hours into the flight; another four until they reached their destination. Grayson checked the status of the ship&#x2019;s engines and mass drive, then confirmed their route on the navigation screens for the fourth time in the past hour. There wasn&#x2019;t much else a pilot needed to do en route; everything was fully automated while a ship was in FTL flight.<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t dream every night, but almost every other night. It might have been a sign of advancing age, or a by-product of the red sand he dosed himself with on occasion. Or maybe it was just a guilty conscience. The salarians had a saying: the mind with many secrets can never rest.<br><br>He was stalling; checking and rechecking the instruments and readouts to hold what was to come at bay. Recognizing his own fear and reluctance allowed him&#x2014;forced him&#x2014;to confront the situation. Deal with it. He took a deep breath to collect himself, his heart pounding in his chest as he rose slowly from his seat. No sense putting it off any longer. It was time.<br><br>On some level he always knew when he was dreaming. There was a strange haze over everything, a bleary film that left the false reality feeling washed out and muted. Yet through this obscuring filter, certain elements would register with exacting precision, minor details indelibly etched into his subconscious mind. The juxtaposition added to the surreal nature of his dreams, yet also made them somehow more vivid, more intense, than his waking world.<br><br>His feet padded softly over the carpeted aisle as he made his way aft from the cockpit toward the passenger cabin. There, Pel and Keo occupied two of the four seats, sitting kitty-corner across from each other. Pel was a big man with broad shoulders and olive skin. His hair was cropped in a tight afro, and he had a thin black beard extending along the length of his jaw. Seated in the chair facing Grayson as he came into the cabin, Pel was swaying gently back and forth in time to the song coming over his headphones. His fingers tapped lightly against his thigh, his perfectly manicured nails rustling softly against the dark material of his suit pants. His tie was still tight around his neck, but his jacket was unbuttoned and his mirrored sunglasses were tucked away inside the right breast pocket. His eyes were nearly closed; he&#x2019;d lost himself in the rhythms of the music&#x2014;a peaceful, easy image at odds with his reputation as one of Terra Firma&#x2019;s top personal protection agents.<br><br>Keo wore the same suit as her partner minus the tie, but she lacked the imposing physical size one typically expected in a bodyguard. She was a full foot shorter than Pel and maybe half his weight, though there was a tautness to her wiry muscles that hinted at the violence she was capable of inflicting.<br><br>Her exact age was difficult to pin down, though Grayson knew she had to be at least forty. With advances in nutrition and gene therapy to reduce the effects of aging, it was common for people to look as young and healthy at fifty as they did at thirty, and Keo&#x2019;s unusual appearance made it even harder to estimate how old or young she might be. Her pale skin was the color of chalk, giving her a ghostly appearance, and her silver hair was shaved short enough to glimpse the pasty-white flesh of her scalp beneath.<br><br>Intermarriage between the various ethnicities of Earth over the past two centuries had made alabaster skin a rarity, and Grayson suspected Keo&#x2019;s stark complexion was the result of a minor pigment deficiency she had never bothered to reverse . . . although it was entirely possible she had undergone elective skin-lightening for cosmetic purposes. After all, visibility was a key aspect of her job: let people know you&#x2019;re on duty, and they&#x2019;ll think twice before doing anything stupid. Keo&#x2019;s odd appearance definitely made her stand out in a crowd despite her stature.<br><br>She was facing away from Grayson, but she twisted around in her seat to watch him as he entered the cabin. She looked tense and coiled, ready for anything&#x2014;a complete contrast to Pel&#x2019;s easy calm. Unlike her partner, she seemed incapable of relaxing, even under the most mundane circumstances.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d; she demanded at his approach, eyeing the pilot suspiciously.<br><br>Grayson froze and raised his hands in the air so they were level with his shoulders. &#x201c;Just getting a drink,&#x201d; he assured her.<br><br>His body was charged with nervous anticipation, the tips of his fingers were actually tingling. But he was careful to betray no hint of this in his voice.<br><br>This particular dream was all too familiar. Over the past ten years he had relived his first kill hundreds, if not thousands, of times. There had been other assignments, of course; other deaths. In the service of the greater cause he had taken many, many lives. If humanity was to survive&#x2014;to triumph over all the other species&#x2014;sacrifices had to be made. But of all the sacrifices, of all the lives he had taken, of all the missions he had completed, this was the one he dreamed of more than any other.<br><br>Satisfied the pilot posed no immediate threat, Keo turned away from him and settled back down in her seat, though she still seemed ready to lash out at the slightest provocation. Grayson made his way behind her toward the small fridge in the corner of the passenger cabin. He swallowed hard, his throat so dry and tight it actually hurt. He half-imagined he saw her ears twitch at the sound.<br><br>From the corner of his eye he saw Pel remove his headphones, dropping them casually into the seat beside him as he stood up to stretch. &#x201c;How long till we land?&#x201d; he asked, his words partially stifled by a yawn.<br><br>&#x201c;Four hours,&#x201d; Grayson replied as he opened the fridge and ducked down to inspect the contents, struggling to keep his breathing calm and even.<br><br>&#x201c;No complications?&#x201d; Pel asked as the pilot rummaged around in the chilled contents of the fridge.<br><br>&#x201c;Everything&#x2019;s right on schedule,&#x201d; Grayson replied, wrapping his left hand around a bottled water while his right grasped the handle of the long, thin serrated blade he had stashed inside the icebox before the journey began.<br><br>Even though he knew this was a dream, Grayson was powerless to change anything that was about to happen. The episode would continue without variance or alteration. He was trapped in the role of passive observer; a witness forced to watch through his own eyes as events unfolded along their original course, his subconscious refusing to allow him to alter his own personal history.<br><br>&#x201c;Guess I&#x2019;ll go check on sleeping beauty,&#x201d; Pel said nonchalantly, giving Grayson the code phrase for the final go. There was no turning back now.<br><br>There was only one other passenger on board: Claude Menneau, one of the highest ranking members of the pro-human Terra Firma political party. A man of vast wealth and power, he was a charismatic, though not necessarily likable, public figure; the kind of man who could afford a private interstellar vessel, complete with his own pilot and a pair of full-time bodyguards to accompany him on his frequent trips.<br><br>In what had become a familiar routine, Menneau had locked himself away in the VIP room in the aft of the vessel just after takeoff. There he would rest and prepare for his upcoming public appearance. In a few hours they were scheduled to touch down at the civilian spaceport on Shanxi, where Menneau would address a fevered crowd of Terra Firma supporters.<br><br>In the wake of the Nashan Stellar Dynamics kickback scandal, Inez Simmons had been forced to step down from her role as party leader. It was clear either Menneau or a man named Charles Saracino would succeed her at the Terra Firma helm, and both were making frequent trips to the various human colonies to drum up support.<br><br>Menneau was currently ahead in the polls by a full three points. But things were about to change. The Illusive Man wanted Saracino to win, and the Illusive Man always got what he wanted.<br><br>Grayson stood up from the fridge, shielding the knife from view with the bottled water in case Keo happened to be looking his way. To his relief, she was still seated facing away from him, her attention focused on Pel&#x2019;s back as he made his way with long, easy strides toward the VIP room in the tail of the vessel.<br><br>The chilled condensation on the water bottle made his left palm cold and damp. The right was damp, too&#x2014;hot and sweaty from being clenched too tightly around the handle of his weapon. He took a silent step forward so that he was standing only inches behind Keo, her bare neck exposed and vulnerable.<br><br>Pel would never have been able to get this close to her; not without raising suspicion and putting her on guard. Despite nearly six months working together as bodyguards for Menneau, she still didn&#x2019;t completely trust her partner. Pel was a former mercenary, a professional killer with a murky past. Keo always kept half an eye on him. That was why it had to be Grayson. She might not trust him&#x2014;Keo didn&#x2019;t trust anybody&#x2014;but she didn&#x2019;t watch his every move like she did with Pel.<br><br>He held the weapon poised to strike, took a deep breath, then stabbed forward with the blade, striking at an upward angle toward the soft spot in the skull just behind Keo&#x2019;s ear. It should have been a quick, clean kill. But his momentary hesitation cost him; it gave Keo a chance to sense the attack before it came. Reacting with a survival instinct honed over countless missions, she leaped from her seat, spinning to face her attacker even as the blade plunged home. Her incredible reflexes saved her from instantaneous death; instead of sliding smoothly up into her brain the knife buried itself deep in the flesh of her neck, where it stuck fast.</p><h2>Wilton Decorating Cakes Book (The Wilton school)</h2><p>This exciting book presents what Wilton has learned in 78 years of teaching cake decorating in an easy-to-follow format that reflects today&#39;s lifestyles.

In this mesmerizing reflection on flying, Mark Vanhoenacker, a 747 pilot who left academia and a career in the business world to pursue his childhood dream of flying, helps us to reimagine what we&#x2014;as pilots and as passengers&#x2014;are actually doing when we enter the world between departure and discovery. In a seamless fusion of history, politics, geography, meteorology, ecology, family, and physics, Vanhoenacker vaults across geographical and cultural boundaries; above mountains, oceans, and deserts; through snow, wind, and rain, renewing a simultaneously humbling and almost superhuman activity and reawakening our capacity to be amazed.</p></p><p><p>Mark Vanhoenacker is a pilot and writer.

Born in Massachusetts, he trained as a historian and worked as a management consultant before starting his flight training in Britain in 2001. His airline career began in 2003.

When I was a child I used to assemble model airplanes and hang them in my bedroom, under a ceiling scattered with glow-in-the-dark stars, until the day skies were hardly less busy than Heathrow&#x2019;s, and at night the outlines of the dark jets crossed against the indoor&nbsp;constellations.&nbsp;I looked forward to each of my family&#x2019;s occasional airplane trips with an enthusiasm that rarely had much to do with wherever we were going. I spent most of my time at Disney World awaiting the moment we would board again the magical vessel that had brought us there.<br> &nbsp;<br> At school nearly all my science projects were variations on an aerial theme. I made a hot-air balloon from paper, and sanded wings of balsa wood that jumped excitedly in the slipstream from a hairdryer, as simply as if it were not air but electricity that had been made to flow across them. The first phone call I ever received from someone other than a friend or relative came when I was thirteen. My mom passed me the telephone with a smile, telling me that a vice president from Boeing had asked to speak with me. He had received my letter requesting a videotape of a 747 in flight, to show as part of a science project about that airplane. He was happy to help; he wished only to know whether I wanted my 747 to fly in&nbsp;VHS&nbsp;or Betamax format.<br> &nbsp;<br> I am the only pilot in my family. But all the same, I feel that imaginatively, at least, airplanes and flying were never far from home. My father was completely enthralled by airplanes&#x2014;the result of his front-row seat on the portion of the Second World War that took place in the skies above his childhood home in West Flanders. He learned the shapes of the aircraft and the sounds of their engines. &#x201c;The thousands of planes in the sky were too much competition for my schoolbooks,&#x201d; he later wrote. In the 1950s, he left Belgium to&nbsp;work as a missionary in the Belgian Congo, where he first flew in a small airplane. Then he sailed to Brazil, where in the 1960s he was one of surely not very many priests with a subscription to&nbsp;<i>Aviation Week</i>&nbsp;magazine. Finally he flew to America, where he met my mother, went to business school, and worked as a manager in mental health services. Airplanes fill his old notes and slides.<br> &nbsp;<br> My mother, born under the quieter skies of rural Pennsylvania, worked as a speech therapist and had no particular interest in aviation. Yet I feel she was the one who best understood my attachment to the less tangible joys of flight: the old romance of all journeys, which she gave to my brother and me in the form of stories like&nbsp;<i>Stuart Little</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Hobbit,</i>&nbsp;but also a sense of what we see from above or far away&#x2014;the gift, the destination, that flying makes not of a distant place but of our home. Her favorite hymn was &#x201c;For the Beauty of the Earth,&#x201d; a title, at least, that we agreed might be worth printing on the inside of airplane window blinds.<br> &nbsp;<br> My brother is not a pilot. His love is not for airplanes but for bicycles. His basement is full of bikes that are works in progress, that he&#x2019;s designing and assembling from far-gathered parts, for me or for a grateful friend. When it comes to his bike frames, he is as obsessed with lightness as any aeronautical engineer. He likes to make and fix bikes even more than he likes to ride them, I think.<br> &nbsp;<br> If I see my brother working on one of his two-wheeled creations, or notice that he&#x2019;s reading about bikes on his computer while I am next to him on the couch reading about airplanes, I may remember that the Wright brothers were bicycle mechanics, and that their skyfaring skills began with wheels, a heritage that suddenly becomes clear when you look again at their early airplanes. When I see pictures of such planes I think, if I had to assemble anything that looked like this, I would start by calling on the skills of my brother&#x2014;even though there was the time I got him in trouble with our parents for skipping his chores, and so he taped firecrackers to one of my model airplanes and lit the fuses and waited just the right number of seconds before&nbsp;throwing the model from an upstairs window, in a long arc over the backyard.<br> &nbsp;<br> As a teenager I took a few flying lessons. I thought that I might one day fly small airplanes as a hobby, on weekend mornings, an aside to some other career. But I don&#x2019;t remember having a clear wish to become an airline pilot. No one at school suggested the career to me. No pilots lived in our neighborhood; I don&#x2019;t know if there were any commercial pilots at all in our small town in western Massachusetts, which was some distance from any major airport. My dad was an example of someone who enjoyed airplanes whenever he encountered them, but who had decided not to make them his life&#x2019;s work. I think the main reason I didn&#x2019;t decide earlier to become a pilot, though, is because I believed that something I wanted so much could never be practical, almost by definition.<br> &nbsp;<br> In high school I spent my earnings from a paper route and restaurant jobs on summer homestay programs abroad, in Japan and Mexico. After high school I stayed in New England for college but also studied in Belgium, briefly reversing the journey my father had made. After college I went to Britain to study African history, so that I could live in Britain and, I hoped, in Kenya. I left that degree program when I finally realized that I wanted to become a pilot. To repay my student loans and save the money I expected to need for flight training, I took a job in Boston, in the&nbsp;field&#x2014;management consulting&#x2014;that&nbsp;I thought would require me to fly most often.<br> &nbsp;<br> In high school I certainly wanted to see Japan and Mexico, and&nbsp;to study Japanese and Spanish. But really, what attracted me most to such adventures was the scale of the airplane journeys they required. It was the possibility of flight that most drew me to far-off summer travels, to degree programs in two distant lands, to the start of the most literally high-flying career I could find in the business world, and at last&#x2014;because none of even those endeavors got me airborne nearly often enough&#x2014;to a career as a pilot.<br> &nbsp;<br> When I was ready to start my flight training, I decided to return to&nbsp;Britain. I liked many aspects of the country&#x2019;s historic relationship with aviation, its deep tradition of air links with the whole world, and the fact that even some of the shortest flights from Britain are to places so very different from it. And, not least, I liked the idea of living near the good friends I&#x2019;d made as a postgraduate there.<br> &nbsp;<br> I began to fly commercially when I was twenty-nine. I first flew the Airbus A320 series airliners, a family of narrow-bodied jets used on short- to medium-distance flights, on routes all around Europe. I&#x2019;d be woken by an alarm in the 4&nbsp;a.m. darkness of Helsinki or Warsaw or Bucharest or Istanbul, and there would be a brief bleary moment, in the hotel room whose shape and layout I&#x2019;d already forgotten in the hours since I&#x2019;d switched off the light, when I&#x2019;d ask myself if I&#x2019;d only been dreaming that I became a pilot. Then I would imagine the day of flying ahead, crossing back and forth in the skies of Europe, almost as excitedly as if it was my first day. I now fly a larger airplane, the Boeing 747. On longer flights we carry additional pilots so that each of us can take a legally prescribed break, a time to sleep and dream, perhaps, while Kazakhstan or Brazil or the Sahara rolls steadily under the line of the wing.<br> &nbsp;<br> Frequent travelers, in the first hours or days of a trip, may be familiar with the experience of jet lag or a hotel wake-up call summoning them from the heart of night journeys they would otherwise have forgotten. Pilots are often woken at unusual points in their sleep cycles and perhaps, too, the anonymity and nearly perfect darkness of the pilot&#x2019;s bunk form a particularly clean slate for the imagination. Whatever the reason, I now associate going to work with dreaming, or at least, with dreams recalled only because I am in the sky.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> A chime sounds in the darkness of the 747&#x2019;s bunk. My break is over.&nbsp;I feel for the switch that turns on a pale-yellow beam. I change into my&nbsp;uniform, which has been hanging on a plastic peg for something like 2,000 miles. I open the door that leads from the bunk to the cockpit. Even when I know it&#x2019;s coming&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s frequently hard to know, depending as it does on the season, the route, the time, and the place&#x2014;the brightness always catches me off guard. The cockpit beyond the bunk is blasted with a directionless daylight so pure and overwhelming, so alien to the darkness I left it in hours ago and to the gloom of the bunk, that it is like a new sense.<br> &nbsp;<br> As my eyes adjust, I look forward through the cockpit windows. At this moment it&#x2019;s the light itself, rather than what it falls upon,&nbsp;that is the essential feature of the earth. What the light falls&nbsp;upon is the Sea of Japan, and far across this water, on the snowcapped peaks of the island nation we are approaching. The blueness of the sea is as perfect as the sky it reflects. It is as if we are slowly descending over the surface of a blue star, as if all other blues are to be mined or diluted from this one.<br> &nbsp;<br> As I move forward in the cockpit to my seat on the right side of it, I think briefly back to the trip I made to Japan as a teenager, about two decades ago, and to the city this plane left only yesterday, though <i>yesterday</i>&nbsp;isn&#x2019;t quite the right word for what preceded a night that hardly deserves the name, so quickly was it undone by our high latitudes and eastward speed.<br> &nbsp;<br> I remember that I had an ordinary morning in the city. I went to the airport in the afternoon. Now that day has turned away into the past, and the city, London, lies well beyond the curve of the planet.<br> &nbsp;<br> As I fasten my seat belt I remember how we started the engines yesterday. How the sudden and auspicious hush fell in the cockpit&nbsp;as the airflow for the air-conditioning units was diverted; how&nbsp;air alone began to spin the enormous techno-petals of the fans, spin them and spin them, faster and faster, until fuel and fire&nbsp;were added, and each engine woke with a low rumble that grew to a smooth and unmistakable roar&#x2014;the signature of one of our age&#x2019;s most perfect means of purifying and directing physical power.<br> &nbsp;<br> In legal terms a journey begins when &#x201c;an aircraft moves under its own power for the purpose of flight.&#x201d; I remember the aircraft that moved ahead of us for this purpose and lifted ahead of us into the London rain. As that preceding aircraft taxied into position its engines launched rippling gales that raced visibly over the wet runway, as if from some greatly speeded-up video recording of the windswept surface of a pond. When&nbsp;<i>takeoff thrust</i>&nbsp;was&nbsp;<i>set</i>&nbsp;the engines hea...</p><h2>Clay: Contemporary Ceramic Artisans</h2><p><p><strong>Captures the feel of the ceramicist&#x2019;s studio with new appreciation for the beautiful, functional, and accessible works being produced by a new generation of makers</strong></p><p>Ceramics is back in a big way, experiencing a steady surge of interest and popularity not seen since the 1970s. The return to the handmade, driven by our increasingly digital lives, means there are now more makers, sellers, and collectors than ever. There is also a new desire for unique objects made by hand and the imperfections associated with the marks of the maker. Pottery captures this authenticity in ways no other medium can.</p><p>From decorative pieces to the beautiful but functional, to sculptural works pushing the boundaries of the medium, <em>Clay</em> surveys the rich creative output of fifty of the top studio potters from around the world. It is a celebration of a new generation of artisans working in clay, a snapshot not necessarily of what is happening at the elite gallery level but rather a behind-the-scenes look at unique and eclectic offerings, both functional and sculptural, from small studios around the world.</p> 250+ color illustrations</p><p>Amber Creswell Bell is an arts, design, and lifestyle writer and creative curator.

They were illustrated not only in bestiaries&#x2015;the compendiums of animal fact and fable that were exceedingly popular in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries&#x2015;but in every sort of manuscript, sacred and profane, from the Gospels to the <em>Romance of the Rose</em>. &nbsp; This book is arranged in manner of a proper bestiary, with essays on the medieval lore and iconography of one hundred creatures alphabetized by their Latin names, from the <em>alauda</em>, or lark, whose morning song was thought to be a hymn to Creation, to the <em>vultur</em>, whose taste for carrion made it a symbol of the sinner who indulges in worldly pleasures. The selection includes a number of creatures that would now be considered fantastic, including the griffin, the manticore, and of course the fabled unicorn.</p><p><br><b>Christian Heck</b>, professor of art history at the University of Lille, is an authority on illuminated manuscripts.<br><b>R�my Cordonnier</b>who holds a doctorate in art history, is head of the cultural heritage department of the library of Saint-Omer, France.<br><b>Featured in <i>Atlas Obscura</i></b><br>&nbsp;<br>"This is a huge and beautiful book that feels almost like a trip to the Cloisters between two covers." <br>&#x2014;<i>New York Daily News</i><br>&nbsp;<br>"Rarely have earnest scholarship and sheer wonder come together as comfortably as they have here.

Recognizing the practical results being received by themselves and by those people who were asking practical questions and then applying Abraham&#x2019;s answers to their own situations, Esther and Jerry made a deliberate decision to allow the teachings of Abraham to become available to an ever-widening circle of seekers of how to live a happier life. Using their San Antonio, Texas, conference center as their base, Jerry and Esther have traveled to approximately 50 cities a year since 1989, presenting interactive Law of Attraction workshops to those leaders who gather to participate in this expanding stream of progressive thought. And although worldwide attention has been given to this philosophy of Well-Being by Leading Edge thinkers and teachers who have, in turn, incorporated many of Abraham&#x2019;s Law of Attraction concepts into their best-selling books, scripts, lectures, and so forth, the primary spread of this material has been from person to person&#x2014;as individuals begin to discover the value of this form of spiritual practicality in their personal life experiences. In November 2011, Jerry made his transition into Non-Physical, and now Esther continues to conduct the Abraham workshops with the help of her physical friends and co-workers and, of course, with the Non-Physical help of Abraham and Jerry. People are able to access Abraham directly by attending the seminars in person or by participating in the online live streaming of most events. There is also an extensive YouTube library of Abraham videos. Abraham&#x2014;a group of uplifting Non-Physical teachers&#x2014;present their Broader Perspective through Esther Hicks. And as they speak to our level of comprehension through a series of loving, allowing, brilliant, yet comprehensively simple essays in print and in sound, they guide us to a clear connection with our loving Inner Being, and to uplifting self-empowerment from our Total Self.

After that, another massive storm seemed to enter the area every few weeks and drop inches, or even a foot, blanketing the landscape and making the town look like a Christmas card, long before the holiday arrived.</p><p>Schools were closed more times that winter than in the previous five years combined. Nearly every week, Doris Patterson finalized the lesson plan for her second-grade class, only to have to change it entirely due to yet another snow day.</p><p>After twenty-nine years of teaching, Doris was accustomed to the unexpected. Where some saw chaos, she saw opportunity. When the principal announced an early dismissal over the PA system, Doris tried to think up a fun, new assignment for her students, to accompany the traditional spelling and math homework. Assignments like What are the flowers thinking beneath the snow? or When do birds make reservations to fly south? Though simple assignments, she&#x2019;d seen them stir her students&#x2019; imaginations, creating wonderful memories for her scrapbook.</p><p>In the last couple of years, Doris had considered retiring but, for whatever reason, had always felt she wasn&#x2019;t ready. Until now. She&#x2019;d recently informed the principal that this would be her last school year. Her husband had retired four years earlier from the post office. He was anxious to hit the wide-open roads with her in a brand-new RV he&#x2019;d purchased, with &#x201c;Herb and Doris&#x201d; airbrushed in blue and pink on the spare-tire cover. Maybe it was all the snow there had been that year, but warm winters in the Southwest had begun to sound good to her.</p><p>Doris never showed favoritism outwardly, but every year there was one child in her classroom who captured her heart. In 1985 that child was Nathan Andrews. Nathan was quiet and introspective. He had sandy hair, huge blue eyes, and a shy smile. Doris noticed that his gentle nature was lacking the spark she&#x2019;d seen in his previous two years at the school. While other students interrupted her with &#x201c;Um, Mrs. Patterson, Charity just sneezed on my head&#x201d; or &#x201c;Hey, Mrs. Patterson, Jacob just hit me with a spitball,&#x201d; Nathan made his way to her desk without calling attention to himself and whispered, &#x201c;Excuse me, Mrs. Patterson.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d then wait patiently until she turned to him. Compared with the boisterous natures of the twenty-five other eight-year-olds in her class, Nathan&#x2019;s measured, serious disposition was, almost in a sad way, beyond his years.</p><p>Some of her colleagues maintained that children from poorer homes were harder to teach, had more disciplinary problems, and were generally mouthier than those students who came from middle- to upper-class homes. Doris disagreed. She knew Nathan&#x2019;s family could be considered lower income. Mr. Andrews worked at a local auto-repair shop and, people said, could barely make ends meet. Yet in all her years of teaching, Nathan was one of the most polite children she&#x2019;d ever met. Doris had learned that it wasn&#x2019;t the size or cost of a home that created kind, well-adjusted children, but the love and attention that filled that home.</p><p>Nathan&#x2019;s mother had often volunteered at the school in the early fall. She had helped out in Doris&#x2019;s classroom, cutting out shapes and numbers for a math lesson, sounding out words for a student struggling with phonics, or stapling paper flowers and trees on the bulletin board. Nathan would beam with pride at the sight of his mother. But Doris hadn&#x2019;t seen Maggie Andrews in many weeks.</p><p>One day her husband, Jack, had come to school to tell Doris that his wife was seriously ill. Maggie Andrews had cancer, and the prognosis wasn&#x2019;t good. No wonder Nathan often seemed distracted. He was not old enough to fully understand the situation and probably didn&#x2019;t know that his mother was dying. But some days Doris could see it in the boy&#x2019;s eyes, a terrible sadness she recognized.</p><p>Her own mother had died of cancer when Doris was only twenty, and that single event had indelibly changed her. Her heart broke for the little boy as she watched him erase a hole into his paper, smoothing the tear with the back of his small hand as he continued with his work. She&#x2019;d never had a student in her class who had lost a parent, and she found herself at a loss for words or actions. Somehow the gentle hug or extra playtime she&#x2019;d given over the years to children who had lost a precious pet or extended family member seemed inadequate, even inappropriate. She still remembered that after her mother&#x2019;s death, she had wished that people would say nothing at all, rather than the trite, though well-meaning words they&#x2019;d offered in sympathy. Sometimes being quiet is the greatest gift you can give someone, Doris thought, as she watched the boy sharpen his pencil, something terribly heartbreaking in the way he struggled to turn the handle. She whispered a silent prayer for God to draw near and wrap the little boy in His arms.</p><p>I slammed the phone down in my office. For the umpteenth time, I had tried to make a call, only to hear a busy signal in my ear. The day was short on hours, and I was feeling even shorter on patience.</p><p>&#x201c;Would somebody tell me how these new phones are supposed to work?&#x201d; I shouted out my office door to my secretary.</p><p>Gwen Sturdivant, my assistant for the past ten years, hurried in to help me.</p><p>&#x201c;First, make sure you select a line that isn&#x2019;t lit up,&#x201d; she explained.</p><p>&#x201c;I know that, Gwen,&#x201d; I said, exasperated. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m thirty-eight years old. I&#x2019;m familiar with the general uses of a telephone. I want to know why I hear that stupid busy signal every time I make a call.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Once you dial, you need to wait for the tone and then punch in one of these codes for the client you&#x2019;re billing to.&#x201d; Gwen calmly demonstrated.</p><p>When I had started with the firm, the phone bill, along with the electric bill and office expenses, had been paid from the firm&#x2019;s general receipts. Now everything&#x2014;the fax machine, the photocopier, the office phones&#x2014;all had a code. As soon as someone could figure out how to program it, my pager would have a code too. Ordinary tasks like dialing the phone had been made more frustrating so the firm could bill our clients right down to the penny.</p><p>&#x201c;Just get Doug Crenshaw on the phone for me!&#x201d; I groaned.</p><p>I had been at Mathers, Williams &amp; Hurst for thirteen years. Like many young attorneys, I had walked in the door a bright-eyed, naively optimistic law-school graduate. We were a small firm at the time, sixteen lawyers, but the location was perfect&#x2014;only a few miles from my mother&#x2019;s home. My father had died of a heart attack five years earlier, and I wanted to move closer to my mother so I could keep an eye on her, in case she needed anything. My wife Kate&#x2019;s family lived only three hours away, so she couldn&#x2019;t have been more pleased when I took the job.</p><p>I spent the first day at MW&amp;H in conference, a conference that had lasted thirteen years: conferences with clients, conferences with other associates, conferences with the firm&#x2019;s partners, conferences with secretaries, conferences with paralegals, conferences at lunch, conferences over the phone. The visions of wowing a courtroom with my verbal prowess faded as the firm&#x2019;s partners shifted many of their bankruptcy cases onto my desk. I had not minded the work at first. It was challenging and fun in the beginning, helping owners of small businesses and corporations liquidate their assets, seeing so many zeroes on a page reduced to one lone goose egg. Somehow my position within the firm as &#x201c;the associate who helped with bankruptcy cases&#x201d; changed over the years to &#x201c;our bankruptcy associate.&#x201d; After I got over my initial disappointment and accepted that my dream of becoming a hotshot courtroom brawler was not going to play out (the bankruptcy cases that made it as far as the courtroom were invariably simple presentations of fact, never the in-your-face litigating tours de force I&#x2019;d always dreamed of performing), I buried myself in the bankruptcy files to impress the partners. My position within the firm established, I concentrated on every young law student&#x2019;s goal: to become partner in just seven years.</p><p>I found that once I put my mind to a task and worked at it diligently, things came together as I had planned. Even with my wife, this seemed true.</p><p>I met Kate Abbott during my last year of law school. From the moment I saw her, I was smitten. She had recently moved into the neighborhood where I was sharing a small apartment with five roommates. My parents had paid for my books and tuition, on the condition that I support myself by taking on odd jobs to pay for food, rent, clothes, and whatever car I could afford. Meals in those days consisted of macaroni and cheese, Ramen noodles, and the rare special of Five Burgers for a Buck at the local Burger Castle. I owned one suit that my parents had bought me for my college graduation, three pairs of jeans, several ratty sweatshirts, two button-down shirts, a pair of loafers with a hole in the sole, and a pair of old running shoes. I would have felt my wardrobe was pathetic had not my roommates&#x2019; clothes looked exactly the same.</p><p>I first saw Kate unloading boxes and secondhand furniture from the back of a U-Haul van. I set out to meet her, and then, once I met her, I set out to marry her. She was raven-haired and lovely. A certain melody filled the air when she laughed. We married a week after I finished law school.</p><p>Like most new law graduates, I was poor and saddled with debt.

She was returning home after her regular day&#x2019;s work in the Montgomery Fair, a leading department store. Tired from long hours on her feet, Mrs. Parks sat down in the first seat behind the section reserved for whites. Not long after she took her seat, the bus operator ordered her, along with three other Negro passengers, to move back in order to accommodate boarding white passengers. By this time every seat in the bus was taken. This meant that if Mrs. Parks followed the driver&#x2019;s command she would have to stand while a white male passenger, who had just boarded the bus, would sit. The other three Negro passengers immediately complied with the driver&#x2019;s request. But Mrs. Parks quietly refused. The result was her arrest.<br> &nbsp;<br> There was to be much speculation about why Mrs. Parks did not obey the driver. Many people in the white community argued that she had been &#x201c;planted&#x201d; by the NAACP in order to lay the groundwork for a test case, and at first glance that explanation seemed plausible, since she was a former secretary of the local branch of the NAACP. So persistent and persuasive was this argument that it convinced many reporters from all over the country. Later on, when I was having press conferences three times a week&#x2014; in order to accommodate the reporters and journalists who came to Montgomery from all over the world&#x2014;the invariable first question was: &#x201c;Did the NAACP start the bus boycott?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> But the accusation was totally unwarranted, as the testimony of both Mrs. Parks and the officials of the NAACP revealed. Actually, no one can understand the action of Mrs. Parks unless he realizes that eventually the cup of endurance runs over, and the human personality cries out, &#x201c;I can take it no longer.&#x201d; Mrs. Parks&#x2019;s refusal to move back was her intrepid affirmation that she had had enough. It was an individual expression of a timeless longing for human dignity and freedom. She was not &#x201c;planted&#x201d; there by the NAACP, or any other organization; she was planted there by her personal sense of dignity and self-respect. She was anchored to that seat by the accumulated indignities of days gone by and the boundless aspirations of generations yet unborn. She was a victim of both the forces of history and the forces of destiny. She had been tracked down by the zeitgeist&#x2014;the spirit of the time.<br> &nbsp;<br> Fortunately, Mrs. Parks was ideal for the role assigned to her by history. She was a charming person with a radiant personality, soft-spoken and calm in all situations. Her character was impeccable and her dedication deep-rooted. All of these traits together made her one of the most respected people in the Negro community.<br> &nbsp;<br> Only E. D. Nixon&#x2014;the signer of Mrs. Parks&#x2019;s bond&#x2014; and one or two other persons were aware of the arrest when it occurred early Thursday evening. Later in the evening the word got around to a few influential women of the community, mostly members of the Women&#x2019;s Political Council. After a series of telephone calls back and forth they agreed that the Negroes should boycott the buses. They immediately suggested the idea to Nixon, and he readily concurred. In his usual courageous manner he agreed to spearhead the idea.<br> &nbsp;<br> Early Friday morning, December 2, Nixon called me. He was so caught up in what he was about to say that he forgot to greet me with the usual &#x201c;hello&#x201d; but plunged immediately into the story of what had happened to Mrs. Parks the night before. I listened, deeply shocked, as he described the humiliating incident. &#x201c;We have taken this type of thing too long already,&#x201d; Nixon concluded, his voice trembling. &#x201c;I feel that the time has come to boycott the buses. Only through a boycott can we make it clear to the white folks that we will not accept this type of treatment any longer.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I agreed at once that some protest was necessary, and that the boycott method would be an effective one. Just before calling me Nixon had discussed the idea with Rev. Ralph Abernathy, the young minister of Montgomery&#x2019;s First Baptist Church who was to become one of the central figures in the protest, and one of my closest associates. Abernathy also felt a bus boycott was our best course of action. So for thirty or forty minutes the three of us telephoned back and forth concerning plans and strategy. Nixon suggested that we call a meeting of all the ministers and civic leaders the same evening in order to get their thinking on the proposal, and I offered my church as the meeting place. The three of us got busy immediately. With the sanction of Rev. H. H. Hubbard&#x2014;president of the Baptist Ministerial Alliance&#x2014;Abernathy and I began calling all of the Baptist ministers. Since most of the Methodist ministers were attending a denominational meeting in one of the local churches that afternoon, it was possible for Abernathy to get the announcement to all of them simultaneously. Nixon reached Mrs. A. W. West&#x2014;the widow of a prominent dentist&#x2014;and enlisted her assistance in getting word to the civic leaders.<br> &nbsp;<br> By early afternoon the arrest of Mrs. Parks was becoming public knowledge. Word of it spread around the community like uncontrolled fire. Telephones began to ring in almost rhythmic succession. By two o&#x2019;clock an enthusiastic group had mimeographed leaflets concerning the arrest and the proposed boycott, and by evening these had been widely circulated.<br> &nbsp;<br> As the hour for the evening meeting arrived, I approached the doors of the church with some apprehension, wondering how many of the leaders would respond to our call. Fortunately, it was one of those pleasant winter nights of unseasonable warmth, and to our relief, almost everybody who had been invited was on hand. More than forty people, from every segment of Negro life, were crowded into the large church meeting room. I saw physicians, schoolteachers, lawyers, businessmen, postal workers, union leaders, and clergymen. Virtually every organization of the Negro community was represented.<br> &nbsp;<br> The largest number there was from the Christian ministry. Having left so many civic meetings in the past sadly disappointed by the dearth of ministers participating, I was filled with joy when I entered the church and found so many of them there; for then I knew that something unusual was about to happen.<br> &nbsp;<br> Had E. D. Nixon been present, he would probably have been automatically selected to preside, but he had had to leave town earlier in the afternoon for his regular run on the railroad. In his absence, we concluded that Rev. L. Roy Bennett&#x2014;as president of the Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance&#x2014;was the logical person to take the chair. He agreed and was seated, his tall, erect figure dominating the room.<br> &nbsp;<br> The meeting opened around seven-thirty with H. H. Hubbard leading a brief devotional period. Then Bennett moved into action, explaining the purpose of the gathering. With excited gestures he reported on Mrs. Parks&#x2019;s resistance and her arrest. He presented the proposal that the Negro citizens of Montgomery should boycott the buses on Monday in protest. &#x201c;Now is the time to move,&#x201d; he concluded. &#x201c;This is no time to talk; it is time to act.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> So seriously did Bennett take his &#x201c;no time to talk&#x201d; admonition that for quite a while he refused to allow anyone to make a suggestion or even raise a question, insisting that we should move on and appoint committees to implement the proposal. This approach aroused the opposition of most of those present, and created a temporary uproar. For almost forty-five minutes the confusion persisted. Voices rose high, and many people threatened to leave if they could not raise questions and offer suggestions. It looked for a time as though the movement had come to an end before it began. But finally, in the face of this blistering protest, Bennett agreed to open the meeting to discussion.<br> &nbsp;<br> Immediately questions began to spring up from the floor. Several people wanted further clarification of Mrs. Parks&#x2019;s actions and arrest. Then came the more practical questions. How long would the protest last? How would the idea be further disseminated throughout the community? How would the people be transported to and from their jobs?<br> &nbsp;<br> As we listened to the lively discussion, we were heartened to notice that, despite the lack of coherence in the meeting, not once did anyone question the validity or desirability of the boycott itself. It seemed to be the unanimous sense of the group that the boycott should take place.<br> &nbsp;<br> The ministers endorsed the plan with enthusiasm, and promised to go to their congregations on Sunday morning and drive home their approval of the projected one-day protest. Their cooperation was significant, since virtually all of the influential Negro ministers of the city were present. It was decided that we should hold a city-wide mass meeting on Monday night, December 5, to determine how long we would abstain from riding the buses. Rev. A. W. Wilson&#x2014;minister of the Holt Street Baptist Church&#x2014; offered his church, which was ideal as a meeting place because of its size and central location. The group agreed that additional leaflets should be distributed on Saturday, and the chairman appointed a committee, including myself, to prepare the statement.<br> &nbsp;<br> Our committee went to work while the meeting was still in progress. The final message was shorter than the one that had appeared on the first leaflets, but the substance was the same. It read as follows:<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Don&#x2019;t ride the bus to work, to town, to school, or any place Monday, December 5. <br> Another Negro woman has been arrested and put in jail because she refused to give up her bus seat. <br> Don&#x2019;t ride the buses to work, to town, to school, or anywhere on Monday. If you work, take a cab, or share a ride, or walk. <br> Come to a mass meeting, Monday at 7:00 p.m., at the Holt Street Baptist Church for further instruction. </i></p><h2>Tending Brigid&#39;s Flame: Awaken to the Celtic Goddess of Hearth, Temple, and Forge</h2><p>Filled with rituals, exercises, and meditations, <i>Tending Brigid's Flame</i> presents the beloved Celtic goddess through three aspects of her sacred flame:<br><br><b>Hearth: The Welcoming Flame</b> opens the door to receive Brigid into your home, to protect and make sacred all the activities of everyday life.

Though many churches focus time and energy on attracting people and counting numbers, the real mission of the church isn&#x2019;t how many people you can gather. It&#x2019;s about training up disciples and then sending them out. The true measure of success for a church should be its sending capacity, not its seating capacity.</p><p>But there is a cost to this.

Greear unpacks ten plumb lines that you can use to reorient your church&#x2019;s priorities around God&#x2019;s mission to reach a lost world.

It begins as the day-to-day record of the life of a typical eleven-year-old girl, preoccupied by piano lessons and birthday parties. But as war engulfs Sarajevo, Zlata Filipovic becomes a witness to food shortages and the deaths of friends and learns to wait out bombardments in a neighbor&#x2019;s cellar. Yet throughout she remains courageous and observant. The result is a book that has the power to move and instruct readers a world away.<br><br>"The only bright thing to come from [Sarajevo's] recent history." -<i>USA Today<br><br></i>"Conveys the bewilderment and horror of modern-day conflict...One of Zlata's gifts lies in throwing a human light on intolerable events." -<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></p><p>Zlata Filipovic wrote her diary between September 1991 and October 1993. Following its publication, she was awarded the Special Child of Courage Award by the Simon Wiesenthal Center. She and her family left Sarajevo in December of 1993, and used the proceeds from the book to launch a charity for child victims of the Bosnian war.Eleven-year-old Zlata Filipovic describes her life in Sarajevo as the clouds of war build, advance and consume her city. The diary is a powerful and moving document and has been released in print and audio simultaneously. Dorota Puzio, a native of Poland, reads with a soft Eastern European accent and the emotional intensity that the diary requires. Her clear pronunciation helps the listener with unfamiliar names. She captures the growth Zlata experiences as she leaves her protected childhood behind and begins to live the day-to-day hardship and deprivation of a city under siege. Zlata&#39;s Diary is a poignant plea for peace and a testament to the futility and waste of war. This sensitive production allows the reader to hear a young girl who cries out for peace. L.R.S.

He is the author of A DEADLY AFFAIR and BLOOD JUSTICE.</p><p><strong>Chapter One</strong> <br>GONE HUNTING<br> <br>Deer hunting is a Michigan phenomenon. A seasonal rite of passage for fathers and sons, mothers and daughters. An economic bonanza for business owners who both welcome the hunters&#x2019; money and despise them for clogging the roads, filling the woods, making it impossible to go out and enjoy a meal or a drink for the last two weeks each November.<br> <br>Some 800,000 hunters pour into the woods. Caravans of cars from the Midwest fill the interstates. They jam the freeway rest stops. Some own hunting cabins. Some camp in motor homes. Others fill the motels along the state and county roads. Many pitch tents and set up camp where their dads and grandfathers have been pitching tents and setting up camps for decades.<br> <br>They fill the restaurants and the bars. It&#x2019;s even an economic boon for the farmers, who get to take some measure of revenge for all the corn and grain stolen from them by the marauding deer of summer and fall. Misshapen carrots that can&#x2019;t be sold in supermarkets are wrapped in big plastic bags and sold as deer bait, to be left in clearings or near blinds in hopes of drawing a whitetail close enough for a killing shot. Huge bags of bait are wedged in between pumps at every gas station, or stacked up out front on the grass next to the driveway. Inside the gas stations, many extra cases of beer are laid in for the siege, too, stacked high and narrowing the aisles.<br> <br>Whitetails love man. They thrive on the edges of his civilization. They sneak into his fields to eat his corn if he&#x2019;s a farmer; if he&#x2019;s a suburbanite, they nibble buds of the lower branches of trees in the spring, trim his lawn in the summer and snag low-hanging or fallen fruit in the fall. In the northern Michigan woods, their population exploded at the end of the 19th century, when the hordes of lumbermen clear-cut tens of thousands of acres of giant white pine, which for a generation supplied the needs of homebuilders across the U.S.<br> <br>As the pines fell to the ax and were hauled off, aspen saplings by the millions with their tender, juicy leaves, and seemingly endless acres of raspberry and blackberry thickets replaced them, an endless, nutrient-rich cornucopia. As the deer population grew, the new forest that grew with them was shaped by their appetite. Voracious feeders of low vegetation, the deer kept things trimmed on the ground as the new trees grew to form a canopy.<br> <br>Other species couldn&#x2019;t compete and left or died. By the mid&#x2013;20th century, the deer were the dominant animal. Where once a sighting of a whitetail was an adrenaline-jolting highlight of the day, something you told folks about later, they became as ubiquitous as squirrels. They spread throughout the state, finding the edges of suburbia to their taste, too.<br> <br>Eventually there were so many whitetails that the hunters and the bureaucrats who ran the state&#x2019;s Department of Natural Resources stopped talking about them as if they were animals and began to refer to them as if they were rows of corn or soybeans. The kill during hunting season came to be called &#x201c;the deer harvest.&#x201d;<br> <br>There were millions of the things. Nearly a million hunters sitting in blinds or stalking through the woods hoping to kill one. In any given year, 300,000 would be successful. Just the rope needed to tie that many big animals to the roof of a car or an SUV was a cottage industry. Add in archery season, and the kill was 500,000 deer.<br> <br>A bountiful harvest, indeed.<br> <br>Copyright � 2006 by Tom Henderson.

No more BMWs. No more architectural or medical careers. Instead, the Mosers drew close with their children, built pallets for money, wore homemade clothes, and bonded with people of their Amish faith and community. Here, in Becoming Amish, they offer a modern couple's honest perspective on that separate and seemingly cloistered world, a perspective that is uniquely insider and outsider at the same time. The Mosers' journey is rich and fascinating all on its own as we learn about the inner workings of the Amish faith, ways and culture&#x2014;what their church services are like, how their businesses succeed at such a high rate, how they are so remarkably connected on a human scale (without Facebook!), how they balance technology in their lives, and more. But though the couple's decision can seem extreme, it can also serve as a mirror that helps us reflect upon our own choices, our own beliefs and values. If we were to be as intentional about our lives, how would we realign our choices big and small to achieve a fulfilling life? The book rounds out the Mosers' tale with interviews, vignettes, and information that adds context, perspective and insight into the Amish faith and culture. The reader learns of a startlingly violent book&#x2014;published in 1660&#x2014;that is central to this pacifist people&#x2019;s belief and is in nearly every Amish home. The reader visits a &#x201c;plain&#x201d; community in the hills of Kentucky&#x2014;a community that lives even more simply than most Amish&#x2014;to discuss &#x201c;the whys&#x201d; of a low-technology life and faith. The reader contemplates an interview with the Lutheran minister who helped lead the Supreme Court case back in 1972 that allowed the Amish to pull their children from public school after 8th grade&#x2014;what compelled him to do that? The Mosers' journey is a tale that deserves to live on, a rich and provocative version of the American dream.</p><p>I first wrote about my lifelong friends the Mosers following the economic crash of 2008. The magazine story I wrote folded into a growing national conversation about people looking for more intentional lives based in simplicity and balance as a way to find greater fulfillment. I wondered what perspective the Mosers, who had left one of America's wealthiest communities to become horse-and-buggy Amish--to surround themselves in Amish grace--could bring to that conversation. The book<i> Becoming Amish</i> grew from my belief that though few modern families would ever become Amish, there were many aspects of the Amish life that could inform today's families as they contemplated the direction an intentional life based on family, community, purpose and richer spirituality might lead. I also saw that the Mosers, as people who grew up in modern, everyday America, brought unique perspective to the topic because they were both insiders and outsiders in the Amish world, and their observations would resonate with contemporary peers. I found it especially gratifying when the Mennonite Information Center, of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, named Becoming Amish as one of the Top 5 reads for giving an accurate portrayal of Amish life.Jeff Smith is an award-winning journalist and editor who has written extensively about the environment, outdoors and lifestyle during the course of his 30-plus year career.

The Complete Drawings</h2><p><p>Celebrated around the world as a literary monument, The Divine Comedy, completed in 1321 and written by Dante Alighieri (1265&#x2013;1321), is widely considered the greatest work ever composed in the Italian language. The epic poem describes Dante&#x2019;s journey through Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven, representing, on a deeper level, the soul&#x2019;s path towards salvation.</p><p>In the last few years of his life, Romantic poet and artist William Blake (1757&#x2013;1827) produced 102 illustrations for Dante&#x2019;s masterwork, from pencil sketches to finished watercolors. Like Dante&#x2019;s sweeping poem, Blake&#x2019;s drawings range from scenes of infernal suffering to celestial light, from horrifying human disfigurement to the perfection of physical form. While faithful to the text, Blake also brought his own perspective to some of Dante&#x2019;s central themes.</p><p>Today, Blake&#x2019;s illustrations, left in various stages of completion at the time of his death, are dispersed among seven different institutions. This TASCHEN edition brings these works together again, alongside key excerpts from Dante&#x2019;s masterpiece. Two introductory essays consider Dante and Blake, as well as other major artists who have been inspired by The Divine Comedy, including Sandro Botticelli, Michelangelo, Eug�ne Delacroix, Gustave Dor�, and Auguste Rodin.</p><p>With an intimate reading of Blake&#x2019;s illustrations, and many close-ups to allow the most delicate of details to dazzle, this is a breathtaking encounter with two of the finest artistic talents in history, as well as with such universal themes as love, guilt, punishment, revenge, and redemption.</p></p><p>Sebastian Sch�tze was a longtime research fellow at the Bibliotheca Hertziana (Max Planck Institute for Art History) in Rome.

As he explains in his introduction, there were two levels of language in the Greek-speaking world, "formal" and "informal". The one was for use in official documents, epic poetry, and philosophy, the other for shopping lists and personal letters--the common idiom of everyday speech. "This is the language used throughout the New Testament ... a rough and earthy language that reveals God's presence and action where we least expect it, catching us when we are up to our elbows in the soiled ordinariness of our lives and God is the furthest thing from our minds." <p> It is in the spirit of this "soiled ordinariness" that Eugene Peterson translates John 1:14 (NIV: "The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us") to "The word became flesh and blood and moved into the neighborhood." Likewise, in Romans 8:3 where the NIV renders "For what the law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by the sinful nature, God did by sending his own son in the likeness of sinful man to be a sin offering," <i>The Message</i> reads, "God went for the jugular when he sent his own son.... In his son, Jesus, he personally took on the human condition, entered the disordered mess of struggling humanity in order to set it right once and for all." Peterson offers no pretense of elevated language or intellectualism, only the insistence that God is relevant in 20th-century work-week and weekend lives. </p><p> This kind of translation is not a new enterprise, however. Tyndale--the man singularly responsible for our English translations of the Bible--is purported to have said in a dispute with opposing clergy, "If God spare my life, ere many years I will cause a boy that driveth the plow to know more of the Scriptures than thou dost." We're simply glad someone of our own generation chose to do the same. <i>--Benjamin Gebhardt</i></p>Many people assume that a book about a holy God should sound elevated, stately, and ceremonial. If this is how you're always viewed the Bible, you're about to make a surprising discovery. <p> <i>The Message</i> brings the life-changing power of the New Testament, the vibrant passion of the Psalms, and the rich, practical wisdom of Proverbs into easy-to-read modern language that echoes the rhythm and idioms of the original Greek and Hebrew. Written in the same kind of language you'd use to talk with friends, write a letter, or discuss politics, <i>The Message</i> preserves the authentic, earthy flavor and the expressive character of the Bible's best-loved books. </p><p> Whether you've been reading the Bible for years or are exploring it for the first time, <i>The Message</i> will startle and surprise you. And it will allow you to experience firsthand the same power and directness that motivated its original readers to change the course of history so many centuries ago.</p></p><h2>The Modern Cook&#39;s Year: More than 250 Vibrant Vegetarian Recipes to See You Through the Seasons</h2><p><i>The Modern Cook&#x2019;s Year&nbsp;</i>offers more than 250 vegetarian recipes for a year&#x2019;s worth of delicious meals.

He graduated from Film Studies at the University of California Santa Barbara, and then moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in the entertainment industry. He currently works as a full-time comic book artist. Kazu lives with his wife in Alhambra, California.Almost too clever and poignant, <i>Amulet</i> is, on the surface, about navigating the murky waters of adolescence and, beneath that, an exploration of abandonment and survival. Emily and Navin are lost children, literally lost in a dark, new world and struggling to save their mother, who has been kidnapped by a drooling, tentacled beast. With stellar artwork, imaginative character design, moody color and consistent pacing, this first volume's weakness lies in its largely disjointed storytelling. There is the strong, young, heroine; cute, furry, sidekicks; scary monsters&#x2014;all extraordinary components, but pieced together in a patchwork manner. There is little hope in his dark world as Kibuishi removes Emily and Navin's frame of safety. Their hopes rest in a magic amulet that seems to be working in the interest of the children&#x2014;until it suddenly isn't. The most frightening element of <i>Amulet</i> is the sense of insecurity we feel for Emily, fighting her way through uncharted terrain with no guide and no support system. This first volume of <i>Amulet</i> isn't a disappointment, but it does feel like a warmup to the main event. If anything, it's a clear indication that Kibuishi has just begun skimming the surface of his own talent. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As a movement, it is clearly headed the wrong direction. And it is growing at an unprecedented rate.From the Word of Faith to the New Apostolic Reformation, the Charismatic movement is being consumed by the empty promises of the prosperity gospel. Too many charismatic celebrities promote a &#34;Christianity&#34; without Christ, a Holy Spirit without holiness. And their teaching is having a disastrous influence on a grand scale, as large television networks broadcast their heresies to every part of the world.In Strange Fire, bestselling author and pastor John MacArthur chronicles the unsavory history behind the modern Charismatic movement. He lays out a chilling case for rejecting its false prophets, speaking out against their errors, showing true reverence to the Holy Spirit, and above all clinging to the Bible as the inerrant, authoritative Word of God and the one true standard by which all truth claims must be tested.</p><p>Widely known for his thorough, candid approach to teaching God&#x2019;s Word, John MacArthur is a popular author and conference speaker. He has served as pastor-teacher of Grace Community Church in Sun Valley, California, since 1969. John and his wife, Patricia, have four grown children and fifteen grandchildren. John&#x2019;s pulpit ministry has been extended around the globe through his media ministry, Grace to You. In addition to producing daily radio programs for nearly two thousand English and Spanish radio outlets worldwide, Grace to You distributes books, software, and digital recordings by John MacArthur. John is president of The Master&#x2019;s College and Seminary and has written more than two hundred books and study guides, each one biblical and practical. Bestselling titles include The Gospel According to Jesus, The Truth War, The Murder of Jesus, Twelve Ordinary Men, Twelve Extraordinary Women, and The MacArthur Study Bible, a 1998 ECPA Gold Medallion recipient.</p><h2>The Warning</h2><p><b>Two roads lead to Mount Hope.

The police brass claim that Andy Brady was dirty, and that his shooting was a suicide attempt. Joanna Brady, his devoted wife and mother of their nine-year-old daughter, knows a cover-up when she hears one . . . and murder when she sees it. But her determined efforts to hunt down an assassin and clear her husband's name are placing Joanna and her surviving family in harm's way&#x2014;because in the desert, the one thing more lethal than a rattler's bite . . . is the truth. </p></p><p><p>J. A. Jance is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of the J. P. Beaumont series, the Joanna Brady series, the Ali Reynolds series, and five interrelated thrillers about the Walker family, as well as a volume of poetry. Born in South Dakota and brought up in Bisbee, Arizona, Jance lives with her husband in Seattle, Washington, and Tucson, Arizona.</p>Jance ( Hour of the Hunter ) has created a taut and poignant mystery. Joanna Brady finds her husband, Andy, shot in the Arizona desert on the night of their tenth wedding anniversary. But this, and Andy's subsequent suspicious death in the hospital, is only the beginning of the destruction of the comfortable world of Joanna and her nine-year-old daughter, Jenny. The police decide that Andy, a sheriff's deputy, tried to commit suicide. He is further implicated as the hit man in a mob rub-out and fingered as a crooked cop with drug-cartel connections. Even his personal life is dragged through the mud, as allegations of an extramarital affair surface. Neither mother nor daughter is spared from the brutality of the accusations: the DEA comes after Joanna, while schoolmates taunt Jenny. All the while, Jance cross-cuts to the contract killer who shot Andy. The conclusion features a classic confrontation, but the post-showdown ending seems trite. Until that moment, however, Jance's tale crackles with tension. Joanna's struggle and pain are affecting; Jance writes with an understanding that character is destiny. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Shroud of Eternity: Sister of Darkness: The Nicci Chronicles, Volume II (The Nicci Chronicles, 2)</h2><p><p><b><i>Shroud of Eternity </i>picks up where Terry Goodkind&#x2019;s <i>New York Times </i>bestseller <i>Death</i><i>&#x2019;s Mistress</i> left off, promising a thrilling brew of bloodshed, sex, deception, and sorcery.</b><br><b></b><br>The formidable sorceress Nicci and her companions&#x2015;the newly powerless Nathan and the youthful Bannon&#x2015;set out on another quest after driving ruthless Norukai slavers out of Renda Bay.

Now she and that little girl must team up to save the nonbeliever unicorns who are beset by seemingly endless rain and are quickly losing their strength and magic. Luckily, as a bolt of lightning flashes and thunder claps, both &#x201c;wished the same wish with all their might,&#x201d; and through the power of wishing they stood together at last! After cavorting with delight, they speed off to rescue the other unicorns, but not so speedily that there isn&#x2019;t time to help some forest creatures and lift some spirits. The act of believing and befriending the little girl was all the other unicorns needed to get their mojo back and together successfully wish the rain away (&#x201c;After what seemed like forever&#x201d;).&nbsp; As in their last collaboration, Rosenthal&#x2019;s&nbsp;magic-filled and effusive text&nbsp;is matched with Barrager&#x2019;s bright, colorful, and joyous illustrations.

VERDICT Unicorn saves other unicorns with the magic of believing, effective wish fulfillment, and the help of a little girl. What&#x2019;s not to like? Sure to be in demand where the previous title was popular.&#x2013;Booklist, October 2017<br>&nbsp;<br>Uni and the little girl from their first outing (Uni the Unicorn, 2014) finally meet.Things are not well in the land of unicorns. Endless rain has meant no sun, no rainbows, and no sparkle for the horned, cloven-hooved creatures. They stand pale and forlorn, huddled under umbrellas. But one unicorn still has a twinkle left: Uni, who truly&#x2014;and magically&#x2014;believes that little girls are real. That deep spirit of believing gives Uni strength to fight the gloom. Somewhere far away (but of course "not that far away"), the blonde, fair-skinned tot with mismatched socks from the previous work looks at the rain and wonders. She feels that she is needed. On the very same clap of thunder and the very same zap of lightning, the girl and Uni make a wish. Suddenly, they are together! When the other unicorns see a real, true girl, they gain strength from the magic of believing as well. Luckily, during the course of wishing the rain away, a double rainbow appears linking Here to There. Uni can now come home with the girl to meet her family. Alas, that is one sequel the dearly missed Rosenthal will never get to write. A sweet story for anyone who needs to find a little sunshine and sparkle.

Pyle makes all the right connections. Best of all, he loves a good mystery and is smart enough, open and radical enough, to never say never." &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b> <br><br>More than 20 years after <i>Where Bigfoot Walks</i> was originally published, Dr. Robert Michael Pyle, a Yale-trained ecologist and a Guggenheim fellow, returns with a brand-new chapter that brings his work on the legend of Bigfoot into the new century<br><br> Awarded a Guggenheim to investigate the legends of Sasquatch, Dr. Robert Pyle trekked into the unprotected wilderness of the Dark Divide near Mount St. Helens, where he discovered both a giant fossil footprint and recent tracks. He searched out Indians who told him of an outcast tribe, the Seeahtiks, who had not fully evolved into humans. He attended Sasquatch Daze, where he met scientists, hunters, and others who have devoted their lives to the search, and realized that "these guys don't want to find Bigfoot&#x2015;they want to be Bigfoot!" A handful of open-minded biologists and anthropologists countered the tabloids he studied, while rogue Forest Service employees and loggers swore of an industry conspiracy to deep-six accounts of unknown, upright hominoid apes among us. <br><br> In the years since publication, the author's fresh experiences and finds&#x2015;detailed in an all-new chapter which includes an evaluation of recent DNA evidence from Bigfoot hair and scat, the study of speech phonemes in the &#x201c;Sierra Sounds&#x201d; purported Bigfoot recordings, Pyle&#x2019;s examination of the impact of the wildly popular Animal Planet series <i>Bigfoot Hunters</i>, the reemergence of the famous Bob Gimlin into the Bigfoot community, and more&#x2015;have kept his own mind wide open to one of the biggest questions in the land.</p><p>A search for the Pacific Northwest&#39;s fabled Bigfoot provides a jumping-off point for nature writer Robert Michael Pyle&#39;s lyrical ruminations on wilderness, isolation, and the occasional triumphs of mystery over so-called progress. Pyle&#39;s well-researched stomping ground is Washington State&#39;s Dark Divide in the Cascade Mountains--this rugged country of loggers and recreationists has been the scene for many sightings of the elusive man-beast. Pyle&#39;s route alternates between desolate clear-cuts and majestic ancient forests, between the inroads of civilization and the dark recesses of the wild. But never does the author get too caught up in proving anything to himself or the reader; this search for Bigfoot has as much to do with locating the wild nature within each of us as it does with finding a legend.<b>Robert Michael Pyle</b> is the author of eighteen books, including <i>Wintergreen; Rambles in a Ravaged Land, Chasing Monarchs, The Thunder Tree: Lessons from an Urban Wildland, Sky Time in Gray&#x2019;s River: Living for Keeps in a Forgotten Place</i> and the recent poetry collection <i>Evolution of the Genus Iris</i>.

When a man and woman decide to join together in marriage, they should do so with full realization of their responsibilities. Marriage is serious business. When two born-again believers know it is God's will for them to marry, they come together before God, a minister and witnesses to join their hearts and lives. They make a public profession of their mutual love and devotion, pronouncing vows and pledging their lives to each other. As they pronounce the marriage vows in faith, the power of God goes into operation and a miracle takes place. They are united by God and become as one in His sight. Their union is threefold: They are joined together spiritually by God, legally by the contract they enter into and physically, when the marriage is consummated. A husband and wife are joined together as Jesus is joined to the Church. It is a miraculous union. This booklet contains the wedding ceremony that I use as a minister of God. It is based totally and completely on the Word of God. As you use this ceremony, I add my faith to yours in believing God for lives of love and harmony for the couples you minister to, in Jesus' name." &#x2014; Kenneth Copeland</p><p>Victory. That word, more than any other, sums up the gospel of Jesus Christ. And preaching that victorious gospel to the world has been Kenneth Copeland&#39;s driving purpose for more than 30 years. An ordained minister, author and internationally recognized preacher, Brother Copeland began his ministry in 1967. Since then, Kenneth Copeland Ministries has grown to include not only its headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas, but offices in Canada, England, South Africa and Australia as well. Best known for his exuberant proclamation that &#34;Jesus is Lord!&#34;, Kenneth Copeland has introduced people the world over to the saving message of faith. However, the vision of KCM includes more than simply introducing people to Jesus Christ. Theirs is a vision of taking believers on to maturity in the principles of faith, love, healing, prosperity, redemption and righteousness. Every day that vision becomes more of a reality through Kenneth Copeland Ministries daily and weekly television broadcasts, monthly magazine, books, teaching tapes, gospel music recordings, meetings and conventions. Through these KCM outreaches, every day thousands of believers from Jacksonville to Johannesburg are moving from defeat, self-doubt and discouragement - to a life of God-given victory.</p><h2>Your Seven-Year-Old: Life in a Minor Key</h2><p><i>Your Seven-Year-Old </i>is devoted to the delightful but often anxious and withdrawn child of Seven. Although any seven-year-old will have moments of exuberance, security, and happiness, in general this is an age of introspection. As it begins, parents and teachers may welcome the quiet after the tussles and tangles of Six. But once the child of Seven starts to withdraw it&#x2019;s almost as though he doesn't know where or when to stop. Seven-year-olds feel picked on by family, friends, and teachers alike; they worry that no one likes them; they expect every little task to prove too difficult to handle; tears come easily at this age.<br> &nbsp;<br> With wit and wisdom, Dr. Ames of the highly respected Gesell Institute and Carol Chase Haber offer insights into what children this age are feeling and thinking, and how parents can best deal with these moody, serious Sevens.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Included in this book:</b><br> � New body awareness<br> � Sulking<br> � Concerns about fairness<br> � Stories from real life<br> � Fascination with horror, gore<br> � Threats of running away from home<br> � Life in the second grade<br> � Books for Sevens and the parents of Sevens<br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>&#x201c;Louise Bates Ames and her colleagues synthesize a lifetime of observation of children, consultation, and discussion with parents.

She is the co-author of several books, including <i>He Hit Me First, Your Seven-Year-Old, Your Eight-Year-Old, </i>and <i>Your Nine-Year-Old</i>.chapter one<br> CHARACTERISTICS OF THE AGE<br> &nbsp;<br> The Seven-year-old is a very special person and Seven a unique and highly distinctive age. It stands out, coming as it does between the positive vigor of Six and the broad expansiveness of Eight.<br> Although any Seven, like anybody else, will have his many moments of exuberance, security and happiness, this is in general an age of withdrawal, of pulling in, of calming down. As it begins, parents and teachers may be somewhat relieved. A little calm and quiet is welcome after the tussles and tangles of Six.<br> But once the child of Seven starts to withdraw, it is almost as though he doesn&#x2019;t know where or when to stop. He goes on and on with his withdrawal until it almost seems that he might be more comfortable and contented if there were actually no other people in the world. Some Six-year-olds seem ready to talk to almost anybody, to share themselves and their ideas and warm emotions. Seven may be much more silent and less giving in company.<br> &nbsp;<br> People all too often do not behave in a way that satisfies the child of this age, who thinks they are mean, hateful, unfriendly, always picking on him. He thinks his teacher, especially, picks on him, and parents of Seven-year-olds are well advised not to believe all the tales of maltreatment and unfairness that their children may bring home from school.<br> &nbsp;<br> Seven-year-olds tend to think that people don&#x2019;t like them, or fear that people may not like them: &#x201c;Of course the kids will make fun of me.&#x201d; The child may often be moody, morose, and melancholy. Above all, the girl or boy of this age is a worrier: worries about everything&#x2014;the atomic bomb, war, hurricanes, that the family may not have enough money.<br> &nbsp;<br> Seven worries before second grade begins that it will be too difficult and that the things expected may be too hard. A girl worries that her teacher won&#x2019;t like her; she worries not only about her relationship with others but about herself. Any minor pain or discomfort may be interpreted as a fatal illness. If a boy hiccoughs, he may take it as a sign that he is going to die. He may also worry that others close to him will die.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yes, indeed, Seven has many worries and also many fears&#x2014;probably more than at surrounding ages. Sometimes the child is afraid of things that have never happened&#x2014;of being late for school, for instance. More realistic are such fears as fear of the dark. To him the cellar is full of ominous silences, which he tends to misinterpret. Or he may mistake for a burglar, ghost, or spy the clothes that he hung over a chair when he went to bed.<br> &nbsp;<br> However, many Sevens have now conquered earlier fears, such as fear of the dentist or of swimming. Also, many are now willing to tackle scary situations, as did the little girl who traveled alone by plane on a summer vacation. Asked if she was frightened, she replied, &#x201c;Yes, but you have to do scary things if you&#x2019;re going to visit your grandmother.&#x201d; Or a boy may use his flashlight to dispel frightening shadows in his closet, or get his sister to precede him down the cellar stairs, saying politely, &#x201c;Ladies first.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> In addition to having many worries and fears, the child of this age often feels that he has &#x201c;all the bad luck.&#x201d; As one girl expressed it, &#x201c;Why do I always have the bad luck? Why do things so often happen to me? I might as well be dead.&#x201d; The bad luck in this case was that it was time for her to go to bed.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Seven-year-old also tends to feel strongly that parents like brothers and sisters better than they like him and that they do more for others in the family than they do for him. Typical is the boy whose father fixed an old bike for the boy&#x2019;s Five-year-old brother. The Seven-year-old whined to mother, &#x201c;He never fixes my bike. He never does anything for me. Nobody around here ever does anything for me. Nobody cares about me. I might as well be dead.&#x201d; Mother suggested that the boy look in the garage. Maybe Dad had fixed his bike. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; said the boy, &#x201c;he wouldn&#x2019;t do anything for me. He never does.&#x201d; Actually, the father had already fixed the boy&#x2019;s bike as well as his brother&#x2019;s.<br> &nbsp;<br> Seven&#x2019;s characteristic expression may be a frown, with lips curled downward. Tears come easily, although the child may try to hold them back, because he is embarrassed to cry in front of other people. Also, Seven is easily disappointed. Things so often do not turn out as expected. If things go wrong at play, he is likely to leave the group, mumbling to himself, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m quittin&#x2019;.&#x201d; At home a Seven-year-old boy rushes to his room and slams the door; he may even threaten to run away from home. This is not the expansive exuberance that sometimes drove the Four-year-old out into the world, but is simply a desire to get away from what he may consider an intolerable situation.<br> &nbsp;<br> Seven is a good listener and, within his own limits, a good student. He likes to read or be read to, watch TV, talk things over, and work things out for himself. A difficult intellectual problem can prove a challenge rather than cause the frustration it might have at Six.<br> &nbsp;<br> In fact, Seven can be a delightful age if the adult is willing to accept the child&#x2019;s feelings and sensitivities, frequent brooding, and sulking, moodiness, as well as the more pleasant aspects of this quiet, withdrawn age.<br> &nbsp;<br> To some extent, Seven lives in a world of thought and loves to think things through. Just as his hands are busy touching, exploring, feeling everything with which he comes into contact, so his mind is busy observing, reflecting. He takes in infinitely more than he gives out, and his thought processes are probably much more intense than they may appear to be on the surface. He may even talk to himself in front of the mirror. It is as though the child of this age were trying to define himself, and he does this in part by watching the outside world and then thinking over the things he has observed.<br> &nbsp;<br> In fact, Seven expresses at times a fine new sense of growing independence, a wish at least to try to work things out without help instead of expecting others to solve his problems for him, as he did earlier. However, for the most part, neither girl nor boy is especially adventurous, preferring to hang on to the old rather than aggressively tackling the new.<br> &nbsp;<br> Perhaps most helpful to the adult is the child&#x2019;s increasing reasonableness, his willingness (if he is in a good mood) to listen to somebody else&#x2019;s side of the story. Now he can on occasion even lose at a competitive game without blowing up. However, Seven is not an age known for humor. Thus, handling a child through the use of humor may not be as successful as at some other ages.<br> &nbsp;<br> Intellectually one of Seven&#x2019;s most conspicuous characteristics is a tendency toward perseveration, a tendency to go on and on with a task or situation until it is completed to satisfaction or until somebody stops him. From the adult point of view, Seven is apt to overdo, to go on with one thing too long, such as bounce a ball against the side of the house interminably, or read or watch TV for hours. In fact, parents sometimes comment that it is fortunate that books have chapters and that TV programs have endings. If not, it might be almost impossible to separate child from book or television set. Beginnings may be difficult for Seven-year-olds, but once started, it is hard for them to stop.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Seven-year-old becomes more aware of himself as a person. He is less selfish than at Six, but extremely self-absorbed. By absorbing impressions of things seen and heard and read, and by working things over in his mind, Seven seems to be strengthening and building up a sense of self for the time when he will burst out into the world at Eight. The Eight-year-old will take his equipment (his self) out into the world to see what he can do with it. At Seven he is busy improving, strengthening, discovering, his self. So time alone with special pursuits is treasured. Seven likes to have a room of his own to which he can retreat and where he can protect his things.<br> With some Sevens, self-awareness relates strongly to the physical self. Seven is aware of his body and is sensitive about exposing it, especially to the opposite sex; he may refuse to use the toilet at school if there is no door on it; he does not like to be touched.<br> &nbsp;<br> The typical Seven-year-old has rather high standards and ideals, is serious about self and is responsible, and wants to do things right. In fact, many mothers feel that their children are too anxious to be perfect, too much afraid of failure. Many Seven-year-olds, girls as well as boys, do set very high standards for themselves, are ashamed of any mistake, and may wish to bring home only papers that are 100&#x2019;s. This wish for perfection may be the reason why, when engaged in desk work, the child erases so much. (Seven has been called by some teachers &#x201c;the eraser age.&#x201d;) It is hard to get everything just right. Seven keeps working at a task until it is finished. Six is an attacker, a good starter. Seven is more of a finisher.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Carnal Innocence: A Novel</h2><p><i>In the small town of Innocence, Mississippi, days are long, nights are fragrant, and secrets are hard to keep.

Spengler predicted that industrialisation would lead to serious environmental problems and that countless species would become extinct. He also predicted that labour from Third World countries would increasingly outcompete Western workers by doing the same work for much lower wages, and that industrial production would therefore move to other parts of the world, such as East Asia, India, and South America. According to Spengler, technology has not only made it possible for man to harness the forces of nature; it has also alienated him from nature. Modern technology now dominates our culture instead of that which is natural and organic. After having made himself the master of nature, man has himself become technology&#39;s slave. &#39;The victor, crashed, is dragged to death by the team&#39;, Spengler summarises. Finally, Spengler foresaw that Western man would eventually grow weary of his increasingly artificial lifestyle and begin to hate the civilisation he himself created. There is no way out of this conundrum as the unrelenting progress of technological development cannot be halted. The current high-tech culture of the West is therefore doomed, destined to be consumed from within and destroyed. A time will come, Spengler writes, when our giant cities and skyscrapers have fallen in ruins and lie forgotten &#39;just like the palaces of old Memphis and Babylon&#39;. It remains to be seen if this last, and most dire, of Spengler&#39;s prophecies will also come true. The German historian and philosopher Oswald Spengler (1880-1936) was one of the most influential thinkers of the twentieth century. In 1904 he was awarded a doctorate from the University of Halle for a dissertation on the philosophy of Heraclitus. Spengler then left the university to work as a teacher at a gymnasium school in Hamburg. After having received a small inheritance from his mother in 1911, Spengler quit his position as a teacher, moved to Munich, and started out on a new career as a writer. His breakthrough came in 1918 when the first volume of his magnum opus The Decline of the West was published. In The Decline of the West, Spengler argues that civilisations inevitably go through a series of cycles of rise and decline. They are born, bloom, and then fade away as if they were living entities. According to Spengler, Western civilisation has entered its final, declining phase and is slowly dying. The Decline of the West became a bestseller and was widely discussed in intellectual and academic circles. The Decline of the West made Spengler a household name. He became one of the leading figures of the so-called &#39;Conservative Revolution&#39; - an intellectual movement in Weimar Germany that sought to rebuild the German nation based on conservative synthesis of nationalist, conservative, and socialist principles following the fall of the Hohenzollern empire, calling for a &#39;third way&#39; between liberal democracy and Communism. After the Nazis&#39; ascension to power in 1933, Spengler became increasingly marginalised. His last major work, The Hour of Decision, was banned by the Nazi censors due to its criticisms of certain aspects of Nazi ideology. Three years later Spengler passed away from natural causes at his home in Munich.</p><p></p><h2>Tripwire (Jack Reacher # 3)</h2><p><b>Jack Reacher hunts the hunter in the third novel in Lee Child&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling series.</b><br><br>Ex military policeman Jack Reacher is enjoying the lazy anonymity of Key West when a stranger shows up asking for him. He&#x2019;s got a lot of questions. Reacher does too, especially after the guy turns up dead. The answers lead Reacher on a cold trail back to New York, to the tenuous confidence of an alluring woman, and the dangerous corners of his own past.</p><p>Ex-military policeman Jack Reacher is lying low in Key West, digging up swimming pools by hand. He is not at all pleased when a private detective starts asking questions about him. But when the detective, Costello, turns up dead with his fingertips sliced off, Reacher realizes it is time to move on. <p> As in Lee Child's two previous thrillers, <i>Die Trying</i> and <i>Killing Floor</i>, Reacher is soon up to his neck in lethal trouble, this time involving a vicious Wall Street manipulator, a mysterious woman (of course), and the livelihood of a whole community. Even the fate of soldiers missing in action in Vietnam is stirred into the brew.</p><p> But this is not a book by one of the new breed of U.S. thriller writers. Child prides himself on his ability, as an Englishman, to write American thrillers that are utterly convincing in milieu and toughness of action, without a trace of English sensibility. <i>Tripwire</i> is no exception. Every bit as lean and compulsive as its predecessors, it also builds on the freshest aspect of those books: Reacher may be a tough, epic hero, but he always remains human and vulnerable. <i>--Barry Forshaw</i></p>The Bookcassette� format is a special recording technique developed as a means of condensing the full, unabridged audio text of a book to record it on fewer tapes.

Oliver lives and works in Brookyln, New York.</p>PreSchool-K&#x2013;In this whimsical picture book, a young stargazer decides he wants to catch a star. He ventures out at sunrise since he believes the stars will be "tired from being up in the sky all night." He waits all day, only to see one at sunset. The many schemes he concocts prove ineffective, and the sad child heads home along the beach. When he sees a sea star washed up on the sand, he is happy at last to have a star of his own. While the boy's original plan is counterintuitive, the rest of his schemes hold true for what a young child might dream up. The stylized watercolor cartoons are droll and lighthearted, resonating well with the tone of the story.

One shot and this frozen hell of Belgium&#x2019;s Ardennes Forest would be over for me.&nbsp;It was January 1945, seven months since me and the guys in the 101st Airborne&#x2019;s 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment had jumped into that dark sky over Normandy. Now, a handful of us E Company guys were numb from war, death, and bitter cold and snow.

Maybe I&#x2019;m biased because, like me, Joe was Irish, but hadn&#x2019;t he already paid the war piper? And why Guarnere? He gets it trying to save Joe. The Germans are raining down artillery shells like a Fourth of July show gone wrong, and Bill sees Joe out there trying to get up and so runs across the snow to save his buddy. Sort of like one swimmer trying to help another swimmer who&#x2019;s drowning. And, boom, both end up drowning. At least it hadn&#x2019;t been Skip Muck, whose 1st Platoon was a few hundred yards away from our 2nd. He was closer than a brother to me.&nbsp;I blew on my cupped hands to warm them up. I then put my right hand onto the pistol&#x2019;s holster, and around the wooden grip, cold as a frozen salmon. We were virtually surrounded by the Germans, the proverbial hole in the doughnut. And had been here for more than two weeks, though time wasn&#x2019;t easy to keep track of when you couldn&#x2019;t see beyond the fog and snow of some ice boxed forest that&#x2019;s so far from home that you can hardly remember what home is like anymore.&nbsp;Sometimes, in the night, when the quiet wasn&#x2019;t feared as much, I would remember home. Not so much my family or our house in Astoria, where I&#x2019;d grown up near where the Columbia River meets up with the Pacific Ocean, but the cabin.&nbsp;It was snug to the Nehalem River, in Oregon&#x2019;s Coast Range. I lived like an Indian. Swam in the Nehalem each day. Dove for crawdads. Went bird hunting with a bow, carved from a yew tree. While crouched in a foxhole in Bastogne, I remembered watching the riffle in the river, knowing that beneath that water lived sea-run cutthroat trout and crawdads galore. I remembered easing into the current and letting it take me&#x2014;fishing pole in hand&#x2014;wherever it might. I remembered fires on the banks at night. The sound of a hoot owl. And the smell of late-summer blackberries. All things that now didn&#x2019;t seem possible. Unless . . .&nbsp;One shot.&nbsp;I looked at the flames and fingered the pistol, a P38 I&#x2019;d picked up from a German we&#x2019;d taken prisoner in Holland. One shot and I&#x2019;d be back to all that. Not a shot in the head, though a few soldiers were known to do that, too. But in the foot. Hell, there&#x2019;s no sugarcoating it: This was a coward&#x2019;s way out. It wasn&#x2019;t common, but it happened in war: One squeeze of the trigger and you&#x2019;d be unable to fight. You&#x2019;d be a liability to your company, so they&#x2019;d have no choice but to ship you back to the safety of England, maybe even the States. Accidents happen.&nbsp;But would the guys really buy that your gun had accidentally gone off? Don Hoobler&#x2019;s had just yesterday, but he bled to death on the way to an aid station. I&#x2019;d make sure I missed a main artery. Regardless, the price for my ticket home would be my integrity. All these guys forever wondering, Did Malark do it on purpose? But, then, integrity is an easy thing to lose in times of war, accidentally or on purpose. And when you watch others lose theirs, it becomes easier to let go of your own. Hell, back near Utah Beach, you&#x2019;d see the bodies of soldiers stacked up like so much cordwood. Where&#x2019;s the integrity in that? Or hear those stories about 1st Lt. Ronald Speirs gunning down a bunch of German prisoners, even one of his own men, some say. Where&#x2019;s the integrity in that? Or even before the war, at Fort Benning, watch the drumming-out ceremonies. The guys who couldn&#x2019;t cut it&#x2014; the guys who weren&#x2019;t going to make paratroopers&#x2014;would be marched up in front of everybody with a tommy gun at their backs and an officer would strip them of basically everything they had, including their pride. Where was the integrity in that?&nbsp;In war, you quickly realize that you&#x2019;re playing a game of odds. The longer you fight, the better chance you have of something bad happening to you. You die. You get wounded. You get sick. You get captured. Or you quit.&nbsp;Like my father. He quit. Not in war. But in life. Went bankrupt during the Depression&#x2014;he was an insurance man&#x2014; and just quit. Quit trying. Quit caring. Quit noticing anything and anybody around him. When times got tough, when he lost his business, my dad was like some twenty-foot runabout trying to get over the bar at the mouth of the Columbia: crushed to splinters.&nbsp;My father missed World War I because he had been 90 percent blind in one eye; he was 4F so he worked in a spruce mill making airplane parts. But World War I took the lives of two of my uncles, his brothers. Though I never knew them, they were my heroes. I felt a bond with them both. So much of a bond, in fact, that when learning that Easy Company would be shipping out, ultimately to fight the Germans, I felt the need to somehow avenge their deaths. To bring back something&#x2014;some symbol&#x2014;that would tell my family, I did it. I evened the slate. Some sort of souvenir. Like the pistol whose hammer, in the chill of the Ardennes Forest, I now cocked.&nbsp;Truth is, I&#x2019;d gotten to this point for reasons beyond Joe Toye and Bill Guarnere getting their legs blown off. Beyond missing the Nehalem River, I also missed Bernice Franetovich, a girl I&#x2019;d known from Astoria who was now living in New York, where she was a singer. I&#x2019;d started to wonder if it was only a matter of time before everyone in Easy Company was going to wind up like those frozen Germans you&#x2019;d have to all but step over when heading to an outpost. We were like the shipwrecked sailors on a raft, waiting for the sharks.&nbsp;I felt hopeless. Numb. Not from the cold, as I&#x2019;d been since we&#x2019;d arrived in this god-awful forest December 19, but from something that chills you far deeper inside you: death. We&#x2019;d lost more than a dozen guys in the last few weeks, some of whom were my friends. You see a dead enemy soldier and you say, At least it wasn&#x2019;t one of ours. You see a dead American soldier&#x2014;one of your own&#x2014;and you say, At least it wasn&#x2019;t me. You lose a friend and you say, To hell with this. Get me out of here. At the same time, though this might sound strange, you almost envy the peace they now have. No more being cold. No more war. No more pain. All that bad stuff gets left to those of us who remain.&nbsp;Things started swirling in my mind, like a cottonwood bud caught in an eddy on the Nehalem. I didn&#x2019;t say anything because there are certain things soldiers don&#x2019;t talk about. Like a lot of other jabs of pain&#x2014;say, the time after we&#x2019;d gotten back from Normandy when our laundry woman kept handing me clothes for dead guys who weren&#x2019;t going to be needing them&#x2014;I stuffed it deep inside, thinking it would somehow just go away. It didn&#x2019;t. It just builds up, like carrying one more brick on your back, and one more, and more, and more. And finally you say, Enough. I can&#x2019;t walk another step.&nbsp;So I found myself standing in front of that fire, which was growing weaker and weaker as the late afternoon grew darker and darker. Somewhere out there, the enemy still lurked, waiting for morning&#x2014;and me. And somewhere inside me, another enemy lurked as well, waiting for my decision. Soldiers around me smoked cigarettes and made small talk, but I didn&#x2019;t hear a word of it. Instead, I stared at the embers, mesmerized. Slowly, my right forefinger curled around the pistol&#x2019;s icy trigger.&nbsp;Excerpted from&nbsp;Easy Company Soldier&nbsp;by Sgt. Don MalarkeyCopyright@ 2008 by Sgt.

Covey is an instructor in the College of Continuing Education at the University of Colorado at Boulder.Covey's approach is straightforward and impartial. He offers a comprehensive analysis of the literature, judiciously recognizing the work of other historians in this field. At the same time, his contribution stems from an insightful monographic focus....This volume is worthy of a wide readership across disciplines....A precise and substantial work that serves as a functional primer for slavery and medicine in the United States. (<i>Journal of Southern History, August 2008</i>)<br><br>This is an excellent treatment of a subject of increasing interest for the lay public and scholars alike. The appendix presents a wealth of information previously undocumented as to source, now confirmed and associated with real people as sources. This book has much to recommend it to a wide interdisciplinary audience. This volume cannot help but enrich the reader.

If you want to delve deeper into the world of running and training, this book is for you. You will never look at running the same."-Jackie Areson, 15th at the 2013 World Championships in the 5k. 15:12 5,000m best If you are looking for how to finish your first 5k, this book isn&#x2019;t for you. The Science of Running is written for those of us looking to maximize our performance, get as close to our limits as possible, and more than anything find out how good we can be, or how good our athletes can be. In The Science of Running, elite coach and exercise physiologist Steve Magness integrates the latest research with the training processes of the world&#x2019;s best runners, to deliver an in depth look at how to maximize your performance. It is a unique book that conquers both the scientific and practical points of running in two different sections. The first is aimed at identifying what limits running performance from a scientific standpoint. You will take a tour through the inside of the body, learning what causes fatigue, how we produce energy to run, and how the brain functions to hold you back from super-human performance. In section two, we turn to the practical application of this information and focus on the process of training to achieve your goals. You will learn how to develop training plans and to look at training in a completely different way. The Science of Running does not hold back information and is sure to challenge you to become a better athlete, coach, or exercise scientist in covering such topics as:� What is fatigue? The latest research on looking at fatigue from a brain centered view.� Why VO2max is the most overrated and misunderstood concept in both the lab and on the track� Why &#x201c;zone&#x201d; training leads to suboptimal performance.� How to properly individualize training for your own unique physiology.� How to look at the training process in a unique way in terms of stimulus and adaptation.� Full sample training programs from 800m to the marathon.</p><p>Steve Magness is a coach to some of the top distance runners in the world, having coached numerous athletes to top 15 at the World Championships and Olympic Games.

While never flinching from the realities of Latter-day Saint encroachment on Shoshone land and the racial ramifications of America&#x2019;s spread westward, Parry offers messages of hope. As storyteller for his people, Parry brings the full weight of Shoshone wisdom to his tales&#x2014;lessons of peace in the face of violence, of strength in the teeth of annihilation, of survival through change, and of the pliability necessary for cultural endurance. These are arresting stories told disarmingly well. What emerges from the margins of these stories is much more than a history of a massacre from the Shoshone perspective, it is a poignant meditation on the resilience of the soul of a people.--W.

First published in 1963, Eight Men Out has become a timeless classic. Eliot Asinof has reconstructed the entire scene-by-scene story of the fantastic scandal in which eight Chicago White Sox players arranged with the nation's leading gamblers to throw the Series in Cincinnati. Mr. Asinof vividly describes the tense meetings, the hitches in the conniving, the actual plays in which the Series was thrown, the Grand Jury indictment, and the famous 1921 trial. Moving behind the scenes, he perceptively examines the motives and backgrounds of the players and the conditions that made the improbable fix all too possible. Here, too, is a graphic picture of the American underworld that managed the fix, the deeply shocked newspapermen who uncovered the story, and the war-exhausted nation that turned with relief and pride to the Series, only to be rocked by the scandal.

Williams bases this fictional picture book on the harrowing, real-life experiences of a band of approximately 30,000 southern Sudanese boys, between the ages of 8 and 15, who walked nearly 1000 miles searching for a safe refuge. Eight-year-old Garang Deng, one of the leaders, tells his story. Traveling by night, foraging for food, plagued by violence, hunger, illness, and death, the journey is a perilous one. They finally make it to a refugee camp in Ethiopia where they meet an American named Tom who helps them. But fighting comes to Ethiopia, and once again the boys must flee, this time to Kenya. Tom is there to help. He takes down Garang's story and tells him he will take the story to the U.S. to try to find some help for them. With Tom's departure, life in the camps is very difficult, yet most boys manage to survive. When the man finally returns, Garang, now 21, asks, "Where have you been, Tom? Did you forget about us?" He explains that he has been spreading the news about the boys' plight, and now the U.S. is offering them a home. Christie's distinctive acrylic illustrations, done in broad strokes of predominantly green, yellow, and burnt orange, are arresting in their combination of realism and the abstract, and reflect the harshness yet hopeful nature of the landscape and the situation. An afterword tells what happened once 3800 of the boys resettled in America. This important profile in courage is one that belongs in most collections.&#x2013; <i>Mary N.

Yet no matter how wary and jaded we have become, as individuals or as a society, a part of us remains vulnerable to them: werewolves and wendigos, poltergeists and vampires, angry elves and vengeful spirits.&nbsp;<br><br>In this beautifully illustrated volume, the host of the hit podcast Lore serves as a guide on a fascinating journey through the history of these terrifying creatures, exploring not only the legends but what they tell us about ourselves.

He delves into harrowing accounts of cannibalism&#x2014;some officially documented, others the stuff of speculation . . . perhaps.

But another obsession of Hollywood is vampires.<br><br>You have to admit, though, that there&#x2019;s a lot to love about vampires. Immortality, wealth, power, and superhuman abilities such as flight and strength. Yes, they come with trade-�offs, such as incredibly bad sunburns, but every movie I&#x2019;ve seen (and I&#x2019;ve seen a lot, believe me) tends to show vampires that are fairly happy with their lot in life.<br><br>My exposure to the world of vampires happened in the late 1990s when I was in college. A friend recommended the Anne Rice novel Interview with the Vampire. I devoured that and many of the sequels. They&#x2019;re fun reads, and they certainly set the tone for a decade or more of vampire-�centered entertainment.<br><br>I won&#x2019;t touch on the vampires of the Twilight series, mostly because I haven&#x2019;t read any of the books. But I will say this: those books, however lambasted they have been by critics, have shown that popular culture&#x2019;s love of all things vampire is as undying as the creatures themselves.<br><br>Vampires in History<br><br>When most people think of vampires, they envision something that is a purely European creature: a foreign accent, Victorian-�era dress, and dark manor homes and castles. It&#x2019;s a common visual language for most of the Western world, so I don&#x2019;t blame movies and books for portraying that image. But it&#x2019;s one small facet of a legend that has hundreds of expressions.<br><br>The single most prominent historical figure attached to the modern notion of vampirism is, of course, Vlad III of Wallachia, otherwise known as Vlad the Impaler. Vlad ruled the small Eastern European kingdom of Wallachia from 1456 to 1462.<br><br>He was known as Vlad the Impaler because he preferred to execute his enemies by impaling them on stakes. The Ottomans called him Lord Impaler after entering his kingdom and finding &#x201c;forests&#x201d; of impaled victims. Vlad was a violent guy, you see. Rather bloodthirsty, you might say.<br><br>He, like his father before him, belonged to something known as the Order of the Dragon, a group established to protect Christian Europe from the invading Ottoman Empire. Vlad&#x2019;s father, Vlad II, was known as Vlad Dracul, or &#x201c;Vlad the Dragon.&#x201d; When Vlad III rose to power, he took the hereditary title and was known as Vlad Draculea, &#x201c;son of the dragon.&#x201d;<br><br>That name might sound very similar to the most famous vampire story in the world, and that&#x2019;s because Bram Stoker, when creating his famous creature of the night, used Vlad III as his inspiration. Well, part of it, but we&#x2019;ll get into that more later.<br><br>The roots of most vampire stories, however, can be traced back to superstitions founded in ancient cultures all across the world. Western Europe played host to countless stories of reanimated dead known as revenants. These were animated corpses that climbed out of the grave to torment the living. The word &#x201c;revenant&#x201d; comes from the Latin that means &#x201c;to come back.&#x201d;<br><br>Come back to do what? you might ask. Well, I&#x2019;m glad you did. At first, it was just to terrorize the living, but as the centuries passed, the legend became more specific. Revenants were said to return from the grave to torment their living relatives and neighbors. What was key, though, was that revenants were specific people, not anonymous zombies like the ones from our modern horror genre. These things had a past and a purpose.<br><br>In Norse mythology we can find tales of creatures known as draugr, &#x201c;again-�walkers,&#x201d; who would return from the grave and wreak havoc on the living. These creatures possessed superhuman strength, smelled of decay, and were pretty ugly in appearance. They could enter the dreams of the living, and they were said to leave a tangible object near the sleeping person so that, upon waking, their victims would know their dreams were more real than they feared.<br><br>Let&#x2019;s go back earlier than the Middle Ages, though. The legends of some ancient cultures spoke of creatures that, while not immediately similar to the vampires we know today, nonetheless shared many core characteristics.<br><br>First, we have the Greek myth of Empusa, who was a daughter of Hecate. Empusa was said to lure young men at night and then feast on their blood before moving on to the main course&#x2014;�their flesh. Another Greek tale involves Lamia, a mistress of Zeus who becomes cursed by Zeus&#x2019;s wife, Hera, and doomed to hunt children, devouring them.<br><br>Stories of undead creatures, or creatures that feed on the blood of the living, seem nearly as common as written language itself. On Madagascar, an island nation off the east coast of Africa, there are legends of a creature known as the ramanga, which was known to attack nobles, drinking their blood and eating their nail clippings.<br><br>Yeah, their nail clippings. Deal with it.<br><br>Vampires in Medical Science<br><br>Are vampires real? I&#x2019;ll let you make the final decision on that, but what is clear is that most of these stories find their genesis in the human need to explain the unexplainable. For instance, early Europeans used the myth as a way of explaining why a corpse wasn&#x2019;t decomposing at the normal, expected rate. You can see evidence of this in Bulgaria, where graves dating back more than eight hundred years have been opened, revealing iron rods through the chest of skeletons.<br><br>And in a time when it was not unheard of to bury someone who was thought to be dead, only to find out that they really weren&#x2019;t, you can imagine that stories would quickly circulate that the dead were coming back to life. As a result, taphophobia, the fear of being buried alive, swept Europe and the United States. Of course, once medical science caught up, people got more practical by building alert systems into graves, just in case the person woke up and wanted out.<br><br>I realize that being buried alive sounds like a rare occurrence, but it happened frequently enough that many people were sufficiently paranoid about it to actually spend time looking for a solution. One of those people happened to be a medical doctor, a man named Adolf Gutsmuth. In 1822, and driven by the fear of being buried alive, he invented a &#x201c;safety coffin&#x201d; for his own interment. And he tested it out himself.<br><br>Tested it out? You bet. Dr. Gutsmuth allowed himself to be buried underground in his new &#x201c;safety coffin&#x201d; for several hours, during which he had meals delivered to him through a feeding tube. He enjoyed a wonderful meal of soup, sausages, and a local beer.<br><br>Sounds like a great date-�night destination.<br><br>Dr. Timothy Smith of New Haven, Vermont, was another paranoid inventor. He created a grave that can be visited to this day if you happen to be passing by Evergreen Cemetery. It was a crypt buried in the usual manner, but it had a cement tube positioned over the face of the body. A glass plate was affixed to the top of the tube, at ground level.<br><br>Dr. Smith died a real, natural death, and was buried in his fancy &#x201c;coffin with a view.&#x201d; He never woke up, but early visitors to his grave reported that they had a clear view of his decomposing head until condensation obscured the glass.<br><br>Side note: Vampires no longer scare me. Waking up inside a small box buried six feet below the surface of the earth is what true fright looks like to me.<br><br>Another culprit in humanity&#x2019;s use of the vampire label was porphyria, a rare blood disorder, but modern science has pretty much closed the case on that one, saying that it&#x2019;s too far of a stretch to connect the two topics. Rabies, of all conditions, has also been used as an explanation for the rise of vampire mythology. Surprisingly, there are a lot of commonalities between victims of rabies and vampires, such as sensitivity to light and garlic, as well as altered sleep patterns.<br><br>The most recent medical condition with a strong connection to vampire mythology was actually tuberculosis. Those who suffer from TB had no vampire-�like symptoms, though, and that makes this connection harder to explain. It&#x2019;s also, incidentally, where one of my favorite New England legends comes into the picture.<br><br>Ladies and gentlemen, meet Mercy Brown.<br><br>Lena Mercy Brown was a young woman who lived in the latter half of the nineteenth century in the rural town of Exeter, Rhode Island, and she was a major player in what is now known as the Great New England Vampire Panic.<br><br>Stories like hers can be found all across Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont, echoed in the lives of others in similar situations. And the results have surprising connections to both the modern idea of vampires and the ancient stories, as we will see.<br><br>The first person to die was Mercy&#x2019;s mother, Mary Eliza. That was December 1882, and she fell victim to what was then known as &#x201c;consumption,&#x201d; �so called because as the TB ravaged the body, the person would appear to waste away&#x2014;consumed, if you will, by the illness. She, of course, was buried, because that&#x2019;s what you do with a loved one who passes away.<br><br>The next year, though, Mercy&#x2019;s sister Mary Olive died at the age of twenty. Same illness, same symptoms. I&#x2019;m not sure when the people of Exeter, Rhode Island, started to wonder if the deaths were connected, but it might have been then, or it might have been a few years later when Mercy&#x2019;s brother, Edwin, took ill.<br><br>Edwin, though, was smart. He packed up and moved across the country to Colorado Springs, which had a great reputation for the healing properties of its dry climate. When he returned from the West some years later, he was alive but not doing well. And in December 1891, he took a turn for the worse.<br><br>That was also the month that Mercy herself became ill. Her tuberculosis moved fast, though. They called it the &#x201c;galloping&#x201d; kind, and it moved through her body quickly. By January 1892 she was dead, and the people of Exeter were more worried than ever. You see, they suspected something supernatural.<br><br>Now, this was surprising, considering how close Exeter is to Newport. That&#x2019;s the seaside city known for the &#x201c;summer cottages&#x201d; of the wealthy&#x2014;�folks like the Vanderbilts, the Astors, the Wideners, and the Wetmores. It was the pinnacle of educated society. Yet just a handful of miles away, one small town that should have known better was about to do something very, very creepy.<br><br>Edwin was still alive, you see. And someone got it in their mind that one of the women who died before him, either his mother or one of his sisters, was somehow draining him of his life from beyond the grave. They were so convinced of this, you see, that they wanted to dig them all up.<br><br>Yes. All of them.<br><br>Once they received the father&#x2019;s permission to do this horrible thing, a group of men gathered in the cemetery on the morning of March 17 and began to dig up the bodies.<br><br>What they were looking for was any evidence of an unnatural state. Blood in the heart, blood around the mouth, or other similar signs. The first body, that of Mary Eliza, the mother, was satisfactorily decomposed, though, so they ruled her out. Of course she was, you might say; she had been dead and buried for a decade.<br><br>Mary Olive was also in a normal state of decomposition. Again, being dead ten years usually helps convince people you&#x2019;re really dead. But when they examined Mercy&#x2019;s body&#x2014;�a body that had not been buried because she died in the middle of winter, but instead had been stored in a stone building that was essentially a walk-�in freezer&#x2014;�they discovered a remarkable state of preservation.<br><br>Shocking, I know.<br><br>So what did they do? Well, these superstitious townsfolk did what they learned from their ancestors: they cut out Mercy&#x2019;s heart and liver (within which they found red, clotted blood), burned them on a nearby stone (which is still there, by the way, near her headstone in the cemetery), and then mixed the ashes with a tonic. That tonic was then given to Edwin to drink.<br><br>Yes, Edwin Brown drank his own sister&#x2019;s liver and heart.<br><br>Did it work? Nope. Edwin died less than two months later. What it did do, however, was set up Mercy Brown to be the &#x201c;first American vampire.&#x201d; I suppose it&#x2019;s not important to mention that she wasn&#x2019;t really a vampire, because you are an intelligent person, but it doesn&#x2019;t hurt to say it.<br><br>As unusual as an event like this must sound, you might be surprised to learn that it happened quite frequently. In 1817, nearly a century before Mercy Brown&#x2019;s exhumation, a Dartmouth College student named Frederick Ransom died of TB. His father, so worried that the young man would leave the grave and attack the family, had him dug up. Ransom&#x2019;s heart was cut out and burned on a blacksmith&#x2019;s forge.<br><br>Even Henry David Thoreau heard tales of these types of events, mentioning one in his personal journal. He wrote on September 26, 1859:<br><br>The savage in man is never quite eradicated. I have just read of a family in Vermont who, several of its members having died of consumption, just burned the lungs, heart, and liver of the last deceased, in order to prevent any more from having it.<br><br>So, of course, word spread about what happened to Mercy Brown, as it usually did when a body was dug up and carved into pieces like that. Mercy&#x2019;s case actually made it into a newspaper called the New York World, and it made quite an impression on the people who read it.<br><br>How do we know? Because a clipping of that article was found in the personal papers of a London stage manager after his death. You see, his theater company had been touring America in 1892. He evidently found the story inspiring, so much so that he sat down a few years later and wrote a book.<br><br>The man? Bram Stoker. The book? Oh, I&#x2019;m sure you guessed that already. It was Dracula, published in 1897.</p><h2>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The IDW Collection Volume 8 (TMNT IDW Collection)</h2><p><p> <strong>Presenting the complete <em>TMNT</em> stories in recommended reading order, including one-shots, crossovers, and event series.

In this lively and engaging book, he argues that our brains are wired for social connection. Empathy, not apathy or self-centeredness, is at the heart of who we are. By looking outward and attempting to identify with the experiences of others, Krznaric argues, we can become not only a more equal society, but also a happier and more creative one.<br><br>Through encounters with groundbreaking actors, activists, designers, nurses, bankers and neuroscientists, Krznaric defines a new breed of adventurer. He presents the six life-enhancing habits of highly empathic people, whose skills enable them to connect with others in extraordinary ways &#x2013; making themselves, and the world, more truly fulfilled.</p><p><b>Roman Krznaric</b>&nbsp;is a founding faculty member of The School of Life in London, and advises organizations including Oxfam and the United Nations on using empathy and conversation to create social change. He has been named by The Observer as one of Britain&#x2019;s leading lifestyle philosophers.<b>THE REVOLUTION OF HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS</b><br><p>Empathy has a reputation as a fuzzy, feel-good emotion. Many people equate it with everyday kindness and emotional sensitivity and being tender and caring toward others. This book offers a very different view. Empathy is, in fact, an ideal that has the power both to transform our own lives and to bring about fundamental social change. Empathy can create a revolution. Not one of those old-fashioned revolutions based on new laws, institutions, or governments but something much more radical: a revolution of human relationships.</p><p>Over the past decade there has been a surge of empathic thinking and action around the globe driven by political activists and advice columnists, business gurus and religious leaders. Protesters in the Occupy movement in Britain and the United States erected Empathy Tents and ran workshops on empathic activism. A radio soap opera in Rwanda, listened to by 90 percent of the population every week, inserts empathic messaging into its storyline about Hutus and Tutsis living in neighboring villages, in an effort to prevent a revival of ethnic violence. Hundreds of thousands of schoolchildren have been taught empathy skills through Roots of Empathy, a Canadian education program that has spread to Britain, New Zealand, and other countries, that brings babies into the classroom and turns them into teachers. A German social entrepreneur has established a worldwide network of museums where blind guides have taken more than seven million visitors around exhibits that are in total darkness, to give them the experience of being visually impaired. All these initiatives are part of a historic wave of empathy that is challenging our highly individualistic, self-obsessed cultures, in which most of us have become far too absorbed in our own lives to give much thought to anyone else.</p><p>But what exactly is empathy? And what does it look like in practice?</p><p>First, let&#x2019;s get the meaning clear: empathy is the art of stepping imaginatively into the shoes of another person, understanding their feelings and perspectives, and using that understanding to guide your actions.1 So empathy is distinct from expressions of sympathy&#x2014;such as pity or feeling sorry for somebody&#x2014;because these do not involve trying to understand the other person&#x2019;s emotions or point of view. Nor is empathy the same as the Golden Rule, &#x201c;Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,&#x201d; since this assumes your own interests coincide with theirs. George Bernard Shaw remarked on this in characteristic style when he quipped, &#x201c;Do not do unto others as you would have them do unto you&#x2014;they might have different tastes.&#x201d; Empathy is about discovering those different tastes.</p><p>If you want to grasp just what it means to make the imaginative leap of empathy, then let me introduce you to Patricia Moore, a pioneering figure for today&#x2019;s empathic activists. In 1979, Moore was working as a product designer at the top New York firm Raymond Loewy, which was responsible for creating the curvy Coca-Cola bottle and the iconic Shell logo. Age twenty-six and fresh out of college, she was the only woman designer among 350 men at their Midtown Manhattan office. During a planning meeting to brainstorm a new refrigerator model, she asked a simple question: &#x201c;Couldn&#x2019;t we design the door so that someone with arthritis would find it easy to open?&#x201d; One of her senior colleagues turned to her and replied with disdain, &#x201c;Pattie, we don&#x2019;t design for those people.&#x201d; She was incensed. What did he mean, &#x201c;those people&#x201d;? Riled by his response, she decided to conduct what turned out to be one of the most radical empathy experiments of the twentieth century. She would discover what it was like to be an eighty-five-year-old woman.</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t just want to be an actress pretending to be an elderly person,&#x201d; she told me, &#x201c;I wanted a true immersion character, an empathic character, where I could really walk in someone else&#x2019;s shoes.&#x201d; So with the help of a professional makeup artist, she transformed herself. She put layers of latex on her face so she looked old and wrinkly, wore clouded glasses that blurred her vision, plugged her ears so she couldn&#x2019;t hear well, clipped on a brace and wrapped bandages around her torso so she was hunched over, taped splints to her arms and legs so she was unable to bend her limbs, and finished off her disguise with uneven shoes so she was forced to hobble with a stick.</p><p>Now she was ready.</p><p>Between 1979 and 1982 Moore visited more than a hundred North American cities in her persona, attempting to negotiate the world around her and find out the everyday obstacles that elderly people faced and how they were treated. She tried going up and down steep subway stairs, riding on crowded busses, pushing through heavy department store doors, crossing busy streets before the lights changed, using can openers and, of course, opening refrigerators.</p><p>The result of her immersion? Moore took international product design in a completely new direction. Based on her experiences and insights, she was able to design a series of innovative products that were suitable for use by elderly people, including those with arthritic hands. Among her inventions was a line of potato peelers and other kitchen utensils with thick rubber handles, which can now be found in almost every home. She is credited as the creator of &#x201c;inclusive&#x201d; or &#x201c;universal&#x201d; design, where products are designed for people of all abilities, whether aged five or eighty-five. Moore went on to become an expert in the field of gerontology and an influential campaigner for the rights of senior citizens: she was instrumental in getting the Americans with Disabilities Act onto the statute books. Throughout her career, she has been driven more by the desire to improve people&#x2019;s lives than by the lures of financial success. Now in her sixties, she is currently designing rehabilitation centers where U.S. soldiers who have returned from Afghanistan and Iraq with missing limbs or brain injuries can go to relearn how to live independently, practicing everything from buying groceries to using a cash machine.</p><p>Moore has become famous for her &#x201c;empathic model,&#x201d; which has enlightened a whole generation of designers who now recognize the importance of looking through the eyes of the people who will use the products they create. &#x201c;Universal design is driven by empathy,&#x201d; she explains, &#x201c;an understanding that one size doesn&#x2019;t fit all&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s what my whole career has been about.&#x201d;2</p><p>Her experiment in time travel across the generations is a touchstone for the empathists of the future. Making the effort to look through other people&#x2019;s eyes can be personally challenging&#x2014;and sometimes deeply exhilarating&#x2014;but it also has extraordinary potential as a force for social change.</p><br><b>THE SIX HABITS OF HIGHLY EMPATHIC PEOPLE</b><br><p>Patricia Moore discovered the power of empathy in the 1970s. Then why are so many people suddenly talking about it now? The idea of empathy is not new. It first rose to prominence in the eighteenth century, when the Scottish philosopher and economist Adam Smith wrote that our moral sensitivity derives from our mental capacity for &#x201c;changing places in fancy with the sufferer.&#x201d; But the recent explosion of interest is largely due to groundbreaking scientific discoveries about human nature.</p><p>For the past three hundred years, influential thinkers from Thomas Hobbes to Sigmund Freud have been telling us that we are essentially self-interested, self-preserving creatures who pursue our own individualistic ends. Over time, this dark depiction of human beings has become the prevailing view in Western culture. In the last decade, however, it has been nudged firmly to one side by evidence that we are also Homo empathicus&#x2014;wired for empathy.3 The recent discovery of our empathic selves is one of the most remarkable stories of modern science. I will be telling this story in the next chapter, but in short, there have been pathbreaking advances on three fronts. Neuroscientists have identified a ten-section &#x201c;empathy circuit&#x201d; in our brains which, if damaged, can curtail our ability to understand what other people are feeling. Evolutionary biologists have shown that we are social animals who have naturally evolved to be empathic and cooperative, just like our primate cousins. And child psychologists have revealed that even three-year-olds are able to step outside themselves and see other people&#x2019;s perspectives. It is now evident that we have an empathic side to our natures that is just as strong as our selfish inner drives.</p><p>This radical shift in our conception of who and what we are has started to filter into public life, prompting a wave of fresh thinking about how to educate our children, how to organize our institutions, and what we really need for personal well-being. &#x201c;Looking after number one&#x201d; is becoming an outdated aspiration as we begin to realize that empathy is at the core of being human. We are in the midst of a great transition from the Cartesian age of &#x201c;I think, therefore I am,&#x201d; to an empathic era of &#x201c;You are, therefore I am.&#x201d;4</p><p>Yet for all the unprecedented media coverage and public discussion of empathy, there remains a vital question that few people are talking about&#x2014;and it is the one at the center of this book: How can we expand our empathic potential? We may well be wired for empathy, but we still need to think about how we are going to bring our circuits to life.</p><p>I have spent the last dozen years searching for an answer to this question, exploring the research on empathy in fields from experimental psychology to social history, from anthropology to literary studies, from politics to brain science. Along the way I have delved into the lives of pioneering empathists, many of whom you will meet in these pages, including an Argentinian revolutionary, a best-selling American novelist, and Europe&#x2019;s most famous undercover journalist. I have also done fieldwork, speaking to people from every walk of life about their experiences of empathy, or its absence. Whether they&#x2019;ve been trauma nurses or investment bankers, police officers or professional working mothers, people living on the streets of inner-city London or wealthy Guatemalan plantation owners, almost everyone has a story to tell about stepping into the shoes of others.</p><p>What I have discovered is that highly empathic people have something in common. They make an effort to cultivate six habits&#x2014;a set of attitudes and daily practices that spark the empathic circuitry in their brains, enabling them to understand how other people see the world. The challenge we face, if we hope to fully realize the Homo empathicus that lies within each of us, is to develop these six habits in ourselves as best we can.</p><p>There are habits to suit every temperament and personality, whether you are an extrovert or an introvert, a risk-taking adventurer or a connoisseur of intimacy and subtle emotions. Making them part of your everyday life will change how you think, how you feel, and what you do. You&#x2019;ll start to be fascinated by entering people&#x2019;s mind-sets and trying to see where they are coming from&#x2014;their underlying motives, aspirations, and beliefs. Your understanding of what makes people tick will expand beyond measure and, like many highly empathic people, you may begin to find others more interesting than yourself.</p><p>There is nothing utopian about living by these six habits: the capacity to empathize is one of the great hidden talents possessed by almost every human being.</p><p>Nearly all of us have it&#x2014;even if we don&#x2019;t always put it to use. Only a tiny proportion of people display what the psychologist Simon Baron-Cohen calls &#x201c;zero degrees of empathy.&#x201d; Among them are psychopaths, who have a cognitive ability to enter your mind but make no emotional bond with you (think Hannibal Lecter), and, arguably, some people with autism spectrum disorders such as Asperger syndrome, who have a harder time understanding the emotions and experiences of others. Together they account for no more than around 2 percent of the general population. The other 98 percent of humanity is born to empathize and wired for social connection.5</p><p>We also empathize much more frequently than we would ever imagine. Most of us exercise our empathic brains every day, although we are often not conscious of doing so. When you notice a new work colleague is nervous before giving a presentation, you might try to imagine the anxiety and uncertainty she is feeling, and give her the reassurance she needs. You see someone begging under a bridge, and rather than just pitying him (remember, that&#x2019;s sympathy), you may think about what it feels like to sleep out on a cold winter night or to have people walk straight past you without even bothering to look you in the eye. But empathy is not just about an awareness of the pain and suffering around us. Even when choosing a birthday present for your favorite aunt, you think about the kind of gift that would really delight her&#x2014;someone with her particular tastes, and of her age and background&#x2014;not what you might personally wish for as a present.</p><p>I am convinced that we cannot explain vast realms of social life without acknowledging the reality and importance of everyday empathy. Just try to imagine a world where it did not exist. It is almost impossible to do so. Mothers would ignore the hunger cries of newborn babies. Charities fighting child poverty would fold due to lack of donations. Few people would make the effort to help a person in a wheelchair trying to open a shop door. Your friends would yawn with boredom as you told them about your marriage breaking up.</p><p>This heartless world of indifference is not the one we live in. Open your eyes to it, and you will realize that empathy is all around us; it&#x2019;s the stuff we swim in. Yet if that is the case, what&#x2019;s the problem? Why should we care about cultivating the six habits of highly empathic people? Because at this moment in history we are suffering from an acute empathy deficit, both as a society and in our individual lives.</p><br><b>The Six Habits of Highly Empathic People</b><br><p>Habit 1: Switch On Your Empathic Brain</p><p>Shifting our mental frameworks to recognize that empathy is at the core of human nature and that it can be expanded throughout our lives.</p><p>Habit 2: Make the Imaginative Leap</p><p>Making a conscious effort to step into other people&#x2019;s shoes&#x2014;including those of our &#x201c;enemies&#x201d;&#x2014;to acknowledge their humanity, individuality, and perspectives.</p><p>Habit 3: Seek Experiential Adventures</p><p>Exploring lives and cultures that contrast with our own through direct immersion, empathic journeying, and social cooperation.</p><p>Habit 4: Practice the Craft of Conversation</p><p>Fostering curiosity about strangers and radical listening and taking off our emotional masks.</p><p>Habit 5: Travel in Your Armchair</p><p>Transporting ourselves into other people&#x2019;s minds with the help of art, literature, film, and online social networks.</p><p>Habit 6: Inspire a Revolution</p><p>Generating empathy on a mass scale to create social change and extending our empathy skills to embrace the natural world.</p><br><b>TACKLING THE EMPATHY DEFICIT</b><br><p>In the lead-up to the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Barack Obama made empathy one of his major campaign themes:</p><p>There&#x2019;s a lot of talk in this country about the fed...</p></p><h2>Maneuver and Dock Your Sailboat Under Power: High Winds, Current, Tight Marina, Backing In?

I&#x2019;m constantly learning something new or forgotten from NauticEd.&#x201d;</p><p>In a past life, I ran a global sailboat sharing company. Of course, our biggest day to day financial concern was how to reduce damage to our fleet. Fully, 98% of the damage to our boats happened in the marina. And so, I developed a series of exercises that each of our members would run through with a getting started starting instructor to ensure that they knew how to perfectly maneuver the boat into the dock no matter what the conditions and directions of wind, current and traffic; this before we released the boat to them on their own. This program was so successful that we reduced marina damage incidents by 80% (wish I could say 100% but you just can't teach them all LOL). It also had an added benefit that we didn't initially think about; it increased our member retention because no longer were people quitting the membership because they were intimidated by big boat, big wind, big current, in a small marina.<br><br>This book is a real coming together of the real knowledge that we applied to reduce the damage happening in a real fleet of boats. I repeated the word "real" above on purpose because damage is real and costs real money and the program really worked. It's not just theory of boat operations; its real operations of a boat that will make you confident and competent about maneuvering your boat in a marina.<br><br>So in this book, we first talk about the theory of the operations and then we apply that to dozens of real exercises that we want you to practice, on your own or with a friend, or with a professional instructor. The more you practice these specific exercises, the more you become an expert.<br><br>Grab a copy of this book, grab a friend, a sandwich and a libation (non alcoholic) and sneak out of the office on a windy day and play with these exercises. Have fun and we know you will come back an expert.<b>Grant Headifen</b> is the global director of education for NauticEd, a leading international sailing education and certification company.

Correct names for male and female anatomy are used throughout. The illustrations depict the passing seasons as the baby begins to grow and develop in utero. Westcott's illustrations are digitally produced, and a cut-away view of Mom's abdomen shows the baby's general growth during the interim. The text explains the changes the baby goes through; soon it can hear, grow hair, suck its thumb, etc. Before long, the big day comes and Gus and Nellie welcome their new brother. This book is suitable for young children who are just beginning to ask the question, &#x201c;Where do babies come from?&#x201d; Inquiring minds wishing for more information regarding conception and fertilization will need to look at the myriad other books on reproduction. However, What's in There? is a&nbsp;good first book to recommend to parents.&#x2013;Roxanne Burg, Orange County Public Library, CA&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

He worked as executive chef at Patina in Los Angeles and, in 2007, opened The Foundry on Melrose, which was nominated by the James Beard Foundation as Best New Restaurant in America. He has competed on numerous food shows and has been featured in the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Wine Spectator</i>, <i>Art Culinaire</i>, <i>Los Angeles Confidential</i>, <i>Angeleno</i>, and <i>Los Angeles Magazine</i>. He recently opened Fleishik's, a new modern Jewish deli, in Los Angeles.INTRODUCTION <br><br>I didn&#x2019;t come from a family of world travelers, and I wasn&#x2019;t raised around great food. My only true childhood food memory is of my mother putting a plate on top of thin, crispy grilled cheese sandwiches as they cook. They were delicious, especially the little bits of cheese that oozed out and crisped up on the bottom of the hot pan. But you won&#x2019;t find that technique anywhere in this book.<br><br>My love of food developed first with a love of cooking. I started as a short-order cook while attending the University of California, Berkeley. Caffe Med was an open kitchen, and I enjoyed creating simple, delicious food for the customers who quickly became my friends. I knew immediately I wanted to reach people through food. I never thought I would ascend to being a chef recognized for my culinary talents, but I understood that if I was ever going to make a great sandwich, I had to learn how to make a great steak. As someone who had always taken pride in doing my very best work, I knew I needed to learn more, so I set out to study with some of the finest chefs in the world: David Bouley, Alain Ducasse, Ferran Adri�, Joachim Splichal.&nbsp;<br><br>The more I learned, the more I grew as a chef. But I never lost sight of the fact that what I loved about food was my love of people. I wanted to take what I learned as a chef and apply it to something everyone could enjoy. So when I opened The Foundry on Melrose in 2007, I chose to eschew the highfalutin cheese plate found in every upstart fine-dining restaurant at the time in favor of an elevated grilled cheese. I wanted the everyman walking by my restaurant to&nbsp; think, &#x201c;Hey, I like grilled cheese,&#x201d; and wander unbeknownst into a new culinary experience. I took a stinky Taleggio and put it between two slices of the raisin-walnut bread common to a cheese plate but so uncommon to a grilled cheese. I blended dried apricots and capers into a puree and added sun-dried tomato as a nod to the dried fruits and pickles typically found on a cheese plate. For good measure, I added some shredded short-rib beef that happened to be lying around the kitchen, and my signature grilled cheese, The Champ, was born.&nbsp;<br><br>What follows builds on the spirit of that sandwich. The recipes take what I&#x2019;ve learned about flavor, technique, and texture while working in Michelin-caliber restaurants and puts that knowledge into a package that everyone can relate to&#x2014;the grilled cheese. From making your own American cheese, jams, and pickles to braising meats and exploring reworked classic dishes, this book takes the grilled cheese sandwich to another level, while keeping true to what it is at its core&#x2014;delicious.&nbsp;<br><br>This book is not meant to be a bible. The recipes are not meant to be law. <i>The Great Grilled Cheese Book </i>is instead a point of reference for exploring the many ways this beloved sandwich can be embellished. Each chapter is dedicated to a cheese, so you can easily decide which sandwich to make based on what cheeses are available to you; each recipe makes four sandwiches. In the recipe list at the beginning of each chapter, I&#x2019;ve also labeled the recipes as Vegetarian (V), Breakfast (B), Meat and Fish (M), and Sweets (S) to help you tailor your sandwich to your mood.&nbsp;<br><br>Play with the recipes. Use them as inspiration for your own creations. Most of all, have as much fun making these grilled cheeses as I have had writing this book. I&#x2019;m hoping you&#x2019;ll never look at a grilled cheese the same way again.</p><h2>First Grave on the Right (Charley Davidson Series, 1)</h2><p><p><i>First Grave on the Right</i> is the smashing, award-winning debut novel that introduces Charley Davidson: part-time private investigator and full-time Grim Reaper.</p><p>Charley sees dead people.

A magnificent blend of travel journal, cultural commentary, and historical insight,&nbsp;<i>Black Lamb and Grey Falcon</i>&nbsp;probes the troubled history of the Balkans and the uneasy relationships among its ethnic groups. The landscape and the people of Yugoslavia are brilliantly observed as West untangles the tensions that rule the country&#x2019;s history as well as its daily life.<br> &nbsp;<br> For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.</p><p>Part travelogue, part history, part love letter on a thousand-page scale, Rebecca West's <i>Black Lamb and Grey Falcon</i> is a genre-bending masterwork written in elegant prose. But what makes it so unlikely to be confused with any other book of history, politics, or culture--with, in fact, any other book--is its unashamed depth of feeling: think <i>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i> crossed with <i>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</i>. West visited Yugoslavia for the first time in 1936. What she saw there affected her so much that she had to return--partly, she writes, because it most resembled "the country I have always seen between sleeping and waking," and partly because "it was like picking up a strand of wool that would lead me out of a labyrinth in which, to my surprise, I had found myself immured." <i>Black Lamb</i> is the chronicle of her travels, but above all it is West following that strand of wool: through countless historical digressions; through winding narratives of battles, slavery, and assassinations; through Shakespeare and Augustine and into the very heart of human frailty. <p> West wrote on the brink of World War II, when she was "already convinced of the inevitability of the second Anglo-German war." The resulting book is colored by that impending conflict, and by West's search for universals amid the complex particulars of Balkan history. In the end, she saw the region's doom--and our own--in a double infatuation with sacrifice, the "black lamb and grey falcon" of her title. It's the story of Abraham and Isaac without the last-minute reprieve: those who hate are all too ready to martyr the innocent in order to procure their own advantage, and the innocent themselves are all too eager to be martyred. To West, in 1941, "the whole world is a vast Kossovo, an abominable blood-logged plain." Unfortunately, little has happened since then to prove her wrong. <i>--Mary Park</i></p><p>'Impossible to put down, both timeless and of its time - a travel book and epic narrative history brimming with passion, anger, scholarship and intuition, hatred and love.' <i>Observer</i></p><p>First published in 1942, Rebecca West's epic masterpiece is widely regarded as the most illuminating book to have been written on what was once Yugoslavia, essential for anyone attempting to understand the enigmatic history of the Balkan states.</p><p>'Such incandescent writing - you find yourself wanting to mark every sentence in order to go back and relish it again.'

Now, making brilliant use of extraordinary evidence, the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning historian once again reconfigures the national saga of American slavery and freedom.</p><p>A deeply entrenched institution, slavery lived on legally and commercially even in the northern states that had abolished it after the American Revolution. Slaves could be found in the streets of New York well after abolition, traveling with owners doing business with the city's major banks, merchants, and manufacturers. New York was also home to the North&#x2019;s largest free black community, making it a magnet for fugitive slaves seeking refuge. Slave catchers and gangs of kidnappers roamed the city, seizing free blacks, often children, and sending them south to slavery.</p><p>To protect fugitives and fight kidnappings, the city's free blacks worked with white abolitionists to organize the New York Vigilance Committee in 1835. In the 1840s vigilance committees proliferated throughout the North and began collaborating to dispatch fugitive slaves from the upper South, Washington, and Baltimore, through Philadelphia and New York, to Albany, Syracuse, and Canada. These networks of antislavery resistance, centered on New York City, became known as the underground railroad. Forced to operate in secrecy by hostile laws, courts, and politicians, the city&#x2019;s underground-railroad agents helped more than 3,000 fugitive slaves reach freedom between 1830 and 1860. Until now, their stories have remained largely unknown, their significance little understood.</p><p>Building on fresh evidence&#x2015;including a detailed record of slave escapes secretly kept by Sydney Howard Gay, one of the key organizers in New York&#x2015;Foner elevates the underground railroad from folklore to sweeping history. The story is inspiring&#x2015;full of memorable characters making their first appearance on the historical stage&#x2015;and significant&#x2015;the controversy over fugitive slaves inflamed the sectional crisis of the 1850s. It eventually took a civil war to destroy American slavery, but here at last is the story of the courageous effort to fight slavery by "practical abolition," person by person, family by family.</p> 16 pages of illustrations</p><p>Eric Foner is the pre-eminent historian of the Civil War era.

It was quite controversial at the time of its release--an uncompromising work that transgressed Victorian boundaries between public and private life, and lines of race, gender, and society.</p><p>Keckley's first 30 years were spent as a slave, and the cruelties and injustices of her life are related clearly and succinctly. This enlightening memoir recounts how she was beaten and how she became a dressmaker to support her master and his family, how determined she was to purchase freedom for herself and her son, how her friends in St. Louis came to her aid, how she became Mary Todd Lincoln's dressmaker and close friend, and her perspectives and experiences from her inside view of Lincoln's White House. Keckley emerges as a calm and confident person who speaks of a very tumultuous period of American history.</p></p><p>Only a few years later, however, that relationship was in ruins, when this 1868 book created a scandal. Intended by Keckley to rehabilitate the reputation of the former First Lady--who had run up extensive debts on clothing and other luxuries while in the White House, and found herself unable to repay them after the President's assassination--the book was perceived instead as a betrayal of friendship. <p> Perhaps one of the first examples of celebrity gossip publishing gone awry, Behind the Scenes does, nevertheless, offer an insider perspective on the Lincoln White House that will intrigue armchair historians and fans of biography alike.</p>Elizabeth Hobbs Keckley</p><h2>Why Don't We Listen Better? Communicating &amp; Connecting in Relationships 2nd Edition</h2><p>You can listen your way to better relationships. This often humorous book, loaded with practical tips, examples, and techniques, will bail you out of touchy situations. Dr. Jim Petersen&#39;s powerfully intuitive yet tongue-in-cheek Flat Brain Theory shows how and why we get upset and confused and what to do about it. We may think we&#39;re good listeners, but not many of us are. When others talk, we focus on what we think, rather than what they are trying to say. Few of us know how to use the power of listening to improve life for ourselves or those around us. Jim says that good communication uses the same skills in a professional office, on a date, in a corporate boardroom, or at a kitchen table. He discusses the need to abandon the win-lose mentality of the courtroom-like culture that so often puts us at odds with each other. Listen shows how to improve talking and listening skills using the Talker-Listener Card. This creative use of the;taking turns we learned as children can end arguing as we know it. He presents more than thirty time-tested listening techniques to help you deal with common communication land mines and listen your way to better relationships, from intimate to casual and work-related. Petersen&#39;s pi�ce de r�sistance, the inventive Talker-Listener Card is practical, easy to use and portable, a format that elevates idle banter and argument into the arena of authentic dialogue. When people use the card they help each other relax, think clearer and build empathy and cooperation. He includes chapters on using the Card to improve listening with couples, difficult groups and as a family dinner table game. It along with the book are great resources for counselors and counselees. Why Don&#39;t We Listen Better? presents other original easy-to-use tools and techniques to help people develop skills at what he calls come-alive communication. It is organized in short sections, labeled in the Table of Contents so you can immediately find the technique or idea you want to review. His insights will give you creative ways to handle both daily interactions and the difficult situations of anger, grief and conflict. This veteran counselor&#39;s unique approach to listening has changed lives. He distilled forty plus years of pastoral experience, counseling and teaching into this informal volume loaded with practical tips, examples, and techniques to practice. The informal manner that endears him to novices and experts alike is reflected in this valuable book for anyone who communicates with others.</p><p>About Dr. Jim Petersen: An experienced seminar and workshop leader, Jim Petersen has developed his own practical techniques for improving communication and relationships.

L Asliman's Introduction to <i>Aesop's Fables</i></b><p> Don&#x2019;t count your chickens before they are hatched!&#x201d; He is a wolf in sheep&#x2019;s clothing.&#x201d; She has a sour-grapes attitude.&#x201d; They are killing the goose that laid the golden eggs.&#x201d; He demands the lion&#x2019;s share.&#x201d; Don&#x2019;t be like the boy who called wolf!&#x2019;&#x201d; These expressions are so much a part of our everyday language and culture that they seem to have been with us forever, and that is almost the case, for the fables that produced these proverbial sayings are indeed even older than (to name but three) the modern English, French, and German languages where today they are so much at home. The fables behind these sayings are those of arguably the most famous storyteller of all time, the legendary Aesop. Who was the man who created these timeless literary gems?</p><b>The Man Aesop</b><p>Aesop (sometimes spelled �sop, �sopus, Esop, Esope, or using the Greek form of his name Aisopos) has been known in history and in legend since the fifth century b.c., or earlier, as a gifted Greek storyteller and the author of the world&#x2019;s best-known collection of fables. However, it cannot be proven with any degree of certainty that he existed as a real person. Most modern scholars believe that Aesop was instead a name invented, already in antiquity, to provide attribution for a body of oral tales whose true authors were a number of anonymous storytellers. Martin Luther expressed this view some 500 years ago: Attributing these stories to Aesop is, in my opinion, itself a fiction. Perhaps there has never been on earth a man by the name of Aesop&#x201d; (quoted in Jacobs, <i>History of the Aesopic Fabl</i>, p. 15; see For Further Reading&#x201d;).</p><p>Although it is possible that there was indeed a gifted Greek storyteller by the name of Aesop, his reputation expanded to legendary proportions in the decades and centuries following his death, and with time many more stories and deeds were credited to him than he could have composed and performed. Supporting this view, many of the earliest references to the stories of Aesop refer to Aesopic (or Aesopian) fables rather than Aesop&#x2019;s fables. In other words, Aesopic, an adjective, describes a kind of story and a literary tradition but does not claim to identify a specific author.</p><p>One thing is certain: Aesop, if he existed at all, did not leave behind a collection of written fables. His reputation is that of an oral storyteller, not an author of written literature. The oldest references to his fables refer to tales memorized and retold, not written and read. For example, from Aristophanes&#x2019;s comedy <i>Wasps</i> (written in 422 b.c.) we learn that telling anecdotes and comic stories in the style of Aesop was common entertainment at banquets in ancient Athens. More seriously, in 360 b.c. Plato recorded in his dialog <i>Phaedo</i> (section 61b) that Socrates, under sentence of death in prison, diverted himself by reformulating some of Aesop&#x2019;s fables. Plato&#x2019;s Phaedo quotes Socrates himself: I took some fables of Aesop, which I had ready at hand and knew, and turned them into verse.&#x201d; The doomed philosopher did not have a book or manuscript of Aesop&#x2019;s fables in prison with him, if such a book or manuscript even existed at the time. He knew the fables from memory, as did the partygoers in Aristophanes&#x2019;s comedy.</p><p>The most frequently cited ancient reference to the man Aesop is found in the <i>History</i> of the Greco-Persian Wars written by the Greek historian Herodotus about 425 b.c. Here we learn that Aesop, the fable writer, was a slave of Iadmon, son of Hephaestopolis, a Samian, and that Iadmon&#x2019;s grandson (also named Iadmon) claimed and received compensation for the murder of Aesop. If this account is true, Aesop would have lived during the sixth century b.c. Apart from this sketchy biography, Herodotus recorded essentially no additional details about the fable writer.</p><p>However, later Greek and Roman writers were not so reticent. One body of literature is particularly relevant in this regard. Usually referred to as <i>The Life of Aesop</i>, this work has survived in a number of medieval manuscripts by different anonymous compilers and is based on earlier accounts, now lost. The statements about Aesop&#x2019;s life history contained in the different versions of this work often contradict one another, or they are so miraculous and fantastic as to be unbelievable by modern standards.</p><p>The ultimate source of these accounts is undoubtedly folklore: anonymous legends told and retold by generations of oral storytellers. <i>The Life of Aesop</i> is today generally held to be fiction, but as is the case with many legends, there could be at least a kernel of truth in one or more of the episodes. The following biographical outline has been gleaned from different versions of <i>The Life of Aesop</i>, most prominently the accounts published by Lloyd W. Daly in his <i>Aesop without Morals</i> (pp. 31 90) and the <i>Everyman&#x2019;s Library</i> version of <i>Aesop: Fables</i> (pp. 17 45).</p><p>Aesop was born a slave, or possibly was captured into slavery at an early age. His birthplace is variously stated as Thrace, Phrygia, Ethiopia, Samos, Athens, or Sardis. He was dark-skinned. In fact, it is said that his name was derived from <i>Aethiop</i> (Ethiopian). He was physically deformed: a hunchback, pot belly, misshapen head, snub nose, and bandy legs are often mentioned. Although in his early years he suffered from a serious speech impediment, or according to some the inability to speak at all, he was cured through the intervention of a deity and became a gifted orator, especially skillful at incorporating fables into his speeches.</p><p>As a young man Aesop was transported by a slave trader to Ephesus (in modern Turkey). Because of his grotesque appearance, no one there would buy him, so he was taken to the island of Samos, where he was examined by Xanthus, identified in the manuscripts as an eminent philosopher,&#x201d; but a person whose existence cannot be verified historically. At first repulsed by Aesop&#x2019;s appearance, Xanthus changed his mind when the slave proclaimed, A philosopher should value a man for his mind, not for his body.&#x201d; Impressed with Aesop&#x2019;s astuteness, Xanthus purchased him as a manservant for his wife.</p><p>Aesop soon proved himself to be an irreverent and sarcastic trickster with a clever retort for every occasion. The following episode is typical of many others illustrating how Aesop&#x2019;s quick wit saved him from punishment, sometimes deserved, sometimes not: Xanthus, wanting to know what fate awaited him on a particular day, sent Aesop to see if any crows were outside the door. According to popular belief, two crows would portend good fortune, whereas a single crow would be an omen of bad luck. Aesop saw a pair of crows and reported this to his master, who then set forth with good cheer. Upon opening the door, Xanthus saw only a single crow, for one of them had flown away, and he angrily turned on his slave for having tricked him into beginning a dangerous venture. You shall be whipped for this!&#x201d; said Xanthus, and while Aesop was being readied for his punishment a messenger arrived at the door with an invitation for Xanthus to dine with his friends. Your omens have no meaning!&#x201d; cried Aesop. I saw the auspicious pair of crows, yet I am about to be beaten like a dog, whereas you saw the ominous single crow, and you are about to make merry with your friends.&#x201d; Perceiving the irony and the wisdom of this observation, Xanthus released Aesop and spared him the threatened punishment.</p><p>Aesop&#x2019;s cleverness extended from word to deed. An unrepentant trickster, his pranks ranged from tricking his fellow slaves into carrying the heavier burdens to seducing his master&#x2019;s wife with her unwitting husband&#x2019;s apparent blessing. His tricks often were masked by feigned stupidity on his part, which has led commentators to compare him to the German Till Eulenspiegel and the Turkish Nasreddin Hoca, two of the world&#x2019;s most rascally but beloved tricksters.</p><p>Aesop&#x2019;s legendary wisdom and shrewdness sometimes moved into the realm of the supernatural. He could solve seemingly impossible riddles and conundrums, foretell the future with uncanny accuracy, and unerringly discover hidden treasures. A master of human psychology, he understood what motivated people to act, and used this knowledge to manipulate them to his advantage. As his life progressed he moved to ever greater venues: from a trickster in a slave&#x2019;s workroom to a lecturer in a philosopher&#x2019;s auditorium to a diplomat and councilor in the courts of governors and kings.</p><p>With time his cunning, wisdom, and oratory skills brought him freedom from slavery, but in the end they cost him his life. At Delphi the citizens, offended by his lack of respect for their aristocracy and for their principal deity Apollo, planted a golden cup in his baggage, then accused him of temple theft.</p><p>Sentenced to die by being thrown over a cliff, Aesop pleaded his case with a series of fables, one of which was the story of The Mouse, the Frog, and the Hawk&#x201d; (no. 67 in the present collection). In this tale a frog and a mouse go swimming together in a pool with their feet tied together, but the mouse drowns. The frog, burdened by the dead mouse, is now an easy prey for a hawk, which forthwith captures and devours him.</p><p>Aesop compared himself to the mouse and the Delphians to the frog. You may kill me,&#x201d; he predicted, but my unjust death will bring you great misfortune.&#x201d; Aesop was executed near Delphi, and his dire prediction came true. Shortly after his death the region was visited with famine, pestilence, and warfare. The Delphians consulted the Oracle of Apollo as to the source of these calamities, and they received the answer that they were to make amends for the unjust death of Aesop. Accordingly they built there a pyramid in his honor.<br></p></p><h2>Fresh Ink: An Anthology</h2><p><b><b>All it takes to rewrite the rules is a little fresh ink in this remarkable YA collection from thirteen of the most recognizable diverse authors writing today including Nicola Yoon, Jason Reynolds, Melissa de la Cruz, and many more, and published in partnership with We Need Diverse Books.&nbsp;</b><br><br>"This awesome anthology came together with the fantastic organization We Need Diverse Books, and...combines an all-star cast of talent." --Paste Magazine</b><br><br>Careful--you are holding fresh ink.

Started the engine, cut the emergency blinkers, then honked the horn twice to say goodbye, before pulling off. Moments later, another truck pulled up to the same spot&#x2014;�a replacement. Double-�parked, killed the engine, toggled the emergency blinkers, rolled the windows up until there was only a sliver of space for air to slip through.<br><br> &#x201c;What I wanna know is, why you get to give me one, but I can&#x2019;t give you one?&#x201d; Dante asked, leaning forward, elbows resting on his knees, his eyes on the street as the people in the new truck&#x2014;�a young man and woman&#x2014;�finally jumped out, lifted the door in the back, studied whatever was inside. Brooklyn was being its usual self. Alive, full of sounds and smells. A car alarm whining down the block. An old lady sitting at a window, blowing cigarette smoke. The scrape and screech of bus brakes every fifteen minutes. A normal day for Brooklyn. But for Shay and Dante, not a normal day at all.<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, simple. Two reasons. The first is that I can&#x2019;t risk getting some kind of nasty eraser infection. I&#x2019;m too cute for that. And the second is that my dad will come back, find you, and kill you for marking me,&#x201d; Shay replied, stretching her arms over her head, then sitting back down on the stoop beside Dante.<br><br> &#x201c;Kill me? Please. Your pops loves me,&#x201d; Dante shot back confidently. He wiped sweat from his neck, then snatched the pencil he had tucked behind his ear and gave it to Shay. They had been planning this ever since she got the news&#x2014;�ever since she told him she was leaving.<br><br> &#x201c;Um&nbsp;. . . &#x2018;love&#x2019; is a strong word. He likes you. Sometimes. But he loves me.&#x201d; Shay pushed her finger into her own sternum, like pushing a button to turn her heart on. Or off.<br><br> &#x201c;Not like I do.&#x201d; Dante let those words slip from his lips effortlessly, like breathing. He&#x2019;d told Shay that he loved her a long time ago, back when they were five years old and she taught him how to tie his shoes. Before then, he&#x2019;d just tuck in the laces until they worked their way up the sides, slowly crawling out like worms from wet soil, which would almost always lead to Dante tripping over them, scraping his knees, floor or ground burning holes in his denim. Mrs. Davis, their teacher, would clean the wounds, apply the Band-�Aid that would stay put only until school was over. Then Dante would slowly peel it off because Shay always needed to see it, white where brown used to be, a blood-�speckled boo-�boo waiting to be blown. Kissed.<br><br> ���<br><br> Shay smiled and bumped against Dante before turning to him and softly cupping his jaws with one hand, smushing his cheeks until his lips puckered into a fish face. She pressed her mouth to his for a kiss, and exaggerated the suction noise because she loved how kissing sounded&#x2014;�like something sticking together, then coming unstuck.<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t try to get out of this, Dante,&#x201d; she scolded, releasing his face. &#x201c;Gimme your arm.&#x201d; She grabbed him by the wrist, yanked his arm straight. Then she flipped the pencil point-�side up and started rubbing the eraser against his skin.<br><br> They&#x2019;d been sitting on the stoop for a while, watching cars pull out and new cars pull in. Witnessing the neighborhood rearrange itself. They&#x2019;d been sitting there since Dante helped Shay&#x2019;s father carry the couch down and load it into the truck. The couch was last and it came after the mattresses, dressers, and boxes with shoes or books or shay&#x2019;s misc. in slanted cursive, scribbled in black marker across the tops. Up and down the steps Dante had gone, back and forth, lifting, carrying, moving, packing, while Shay and her mother continued taping boxes and bagging trash, pausing occasionally for moments of sadness.<br><br> Well, Shay&#x2019;s mother did, at least. She couldn&#x2019;t stop crying. This had been her home for over twenty years. This small, two-�bedroom, third-�floor walk-�up with good sunlight and hardwood floors. A show fireplace and ornate molding. Ugly prewar bathroom tiles, like standing on a psychedelic chessboard. This was where Shay took her first steps. Where she took sink baths before pretending her dolls were mermaids in the big tub. Where she scribbled her name on the wall in her room under the window, before slinking into her parents&#x2019; bed to snuggle. This was where she left trails of stickiness across the floor whenever coming inside with a Popsicle from the ice-cream truck. Where she learned to water her mother&#x2019;s plants. Plants they weren&#x2019;t able to keep because now this space&#x2014;�their space&#x2014;�was gone. Bought out from under them. Empty. All packed into a clunky truck that was already headed south. And since Shay&#x2019;s father left early to get a jump on traffic, it seemed like a good idea to let her mother take a much-�needed moment to weep in peace.<br><br> Plus, then Shay could have a much-�needed moment to eraser-�tattoo Dante.</p><h2>Essential Spanish Grammar: All The Grammar Really Needed For Speech And Comprehension (Dover Language Guides Essential Grammar)</h2><p>This Spanish grammar has been designed specifically for the adult with limited learning time.

His bestselling books <i>The Inner Game of Tennis</i> and <i>The Inner Game of Golf</i>, with over one million copies in print, changed the way we think about learning and coaching. But the Inner Game that Gallwey discovered on the tennis court is about more than learning a better backhand; it is about learning how to learn, a critical skill that, in this case, separates the productive, satisfied employee from the rest of the pack. For the past twenty years Gallwey has taken his Inner Game expertise to many of America's top companies, including AT&amp;T, Coca-Cola, Apple, and IBM, to teach their managers and employees how to gain better access to their own internal resources.<br><br> What inner obstacles is Gallwey talking about? Fear of failure, resistance to change, procrastination, stagnation, doubt, and boredom, to name a few. Gallwey shows you how to tap into your natural potential for learning, performance, and enjoyment so that any job, no matter how long you've been doing it or how little you think there is to learn about it, can become an opportunity to sharpen skills, increase pleasure, and heighten awareness. And if your work environment has been turned on its ear by Internet technology, reorganization, and rapidly accelerating change, this book offers a way to steer a confident course while navigating your way toward personal and professional goals.<br><br> <b><i>The Inner Game of Work</i></b> teaches you the difference between a rote performance and a rewarding one.

Covey, author of <i>7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i></b></p><p>Since the publication some two decades ago of his bestselling <i>The Inner Game of Tennis</i> and <i>The Inner Game of Golf</i>, Timothy Gallwey has come to believe that those books' overriding principle--eliminate negative internal interference to bring about positive self-change--is applicable to virtually any activity. Now, in <i>The Inner Game of Work</i>, he applies that principle to the arena where the biggest turn-of-the-millennium game of all is being played. "We are constantly told that we live in an age of change," Gallwey writes, "and nowhere are we told more frequently that we have to change than in the workplace." As on the court and the course, he contends, those changes necessary to survive and thrive can be effectively realized by quieting our inner doubts and learning to rely on our own natural instincts and behavior.<p> How does Gallwey suggest we do this? His method is twofold: "focus of attention ... the quintessential component of superior performance in every activity" and "clarity of desire behind the focus." Through example and clear instruction, he shows how to minimize self-distracting thoughts that serve to undermine our confidence in the workplace and similar settings, and subsequently to begin "playing in the zone" like elite athletes who have learned to visualize their goals unerringly and proceed unremittingly (and almost unconsciously) in their pursuit. It will take no small amount of dedication to put these ideas into practice, but those who do should find that Gallwey's advice relates as well to the working world as it does to the sporting world. <i>--Howard Rothman</i></p>Do you think it's possible to truly enjoy your job?

New technologies also made possible large-scale organization and centralization. Corporations grew exponentially and the rich amassed great fortunes. Those on the short end of these wrenching changes responded in the Populist revolt, one of the most effective challenges to corporate power in American history.<br><br>But what did Populism represent? Half a century ago, scholars such as Richard Hofstadter portrayed the Populist movement as an irrational response of backward-looking farmers to the challenges of modernity. Since then, the romantic notion of Populism as the resistance movement of tradition-based and pre-modern communities to a modern and commercial society has prevailed. In a broad, innovative reassessment, based on a deep reading of archival sources, <em>The Populist Vision</em> argues that the Populists understood themselves as--and were in fact--modern people, who pursued an alternate vision for modern America.<br><br> Taking into account both the leaders and the led, <em>The Populist Vision</em> uses a wide lens, focusing on the farmers, both black and white, men and women, while also looking at wager workers and bohemian urbanites. From Texas to the Dakotas, from Georgia to California, farmer Populists strove to use the new innovations for their own ends. They sought scientific and technical knowledge, formed highly centralized organizations, launched large-scale cooperative businesses, and pressed for reforms on the model of the nation's most elaborate bureaucracy - the Postal Service. Hundreds of thousands of Populist farm women sought education, employment in schools and offices, and a more modern life. Miners, railroad workers, and other labor Populists joined with farmers to give impetus to the regulatory state. Activists from Chicago, San Francisco, and other new cities provided Populism with a dynamic urban dimension<br><br>This major reassessment of the Populist experience is essential reading for anyone interested in the politics, society, and culture of modern America.<br></p><p><br><strong>Charles Postel</strong> is Assistant Professor in the Department of History at San Francisco State University.<br><br>"[A] meticulously researched study..."--<em>New York Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"A highly original contribution to the scholarship on late nineteenth-century reform movements. Rarely has any historian given us such a comprehensive and detailed view of the Populists, in all their rural, urban, and variegated complexity of thought....This is an admirable, sophisticated and highly informative book, one to savor, to reflect upon, and to look forward to the discussions it will surely provoke."--Ronald P. Formisano, <em>Georgia Historical Quarterly</em><p></p><br>"Many who have written about Populism will find their oxen being gored by Postel. This is a good thing, for his is a book well worth arguing with. Postel makes a compelling case for reconsidering parts of the major narratives of Populism and he offers fresh insights into the emergence of modern agribusiness as part of industrial America in parallel with the expansion of the national state....His accomplishment will encourage future students of this complex subject to explore afresh the larger skein of which his set of threads is a very important part."--Robert C. McMath, <em>Reviews in</em> <em>American History</em><p></p><br>"It is rare that a book comes along with the power to redefine the parameters of a major historiographical debate....This is the most important book on Populism in thirty years, and a brief review cannot hope to do it justice.

This is the best intellectual history of Populism since the work of Norman Pollack. Postel's book will cause historians of the Gilded Age to rethink the Populist vision and blueprints for society. Scholars should read this stimulating, provocative, and exemplary study."--<em>The Historian</em><p></p><br>"In his new book, 'The Populist Vision,' Charles Postel offers an original and riveting account of the Populist vision that jump-started 20th-century social reform movements and is still relevant to our contemporary American society."--Ruth Rosen, truthdig.com<p></p><br>"Here is a history as diverse, complex, and surprising as the Populists themselves. Sympathetic but clear-eyed, respectful but unromantic, Postel challenges some of the most entrenched misconceptions in all of American history."--Edward L. Ayers, University of Virginia<p></p><br>"Postel's revaluation of the Populists seeks to make the best parts of their vision relevant to a generation once again troubled by corporate greed and a growing economic chasm between rich and poor. His Populists were not behind, but ahead of their time. They still are."--R. Laurence Moore, Cornell University<p></p><br>"Broadly conceived, impressively researched, and imaginatively argued, this valuable study deserves a wide audience."--Peter H. Argersinger, author of <em>The Limits of Agrarian Radicalism</em><p></p><br>"This is the most significant work on the 1880s-1890s Populist movement since Lawrence Goodwyn's <em>Democratic Promise</em> thirty years ago. Beginning from the premise that Populism was a modern movement, Postel does a wonderful job of revealing the unexpected unities underlying the movement's diverse strands."--Jeffrey Ostler, University of Oregon<p></p><br>"Charles Postel offers a fresh, wonderfully ambitious account of Populism in the 1890s, reassessing both the movement's intellectual emphases and its political contributions. Historians have long needed a thorough reconsideration of the Populists and their relationship to early twentieth-century reformers. In <em>The Populist Vision</em>, they will find new insights and perspectives."--Rebecca Edwards, author of <em>New Spirits: Americans in the Gilded Age, 1865-1905</em><p></p><br>"Charles Postel has written a stern, and compelling, rebuke to scholars who see the Populists as America's greatest mass anti-modernists. Relentlessly--but always fairly--he constructs his case for the modern character of Populist thinking about economics and education, about race and even religion. Above all, Postel shows that the supposedly hayseed Populists were indeed thinkers. This is far and away the best intellectual history of American Populism ever written."--Robert D.

Written in French (with occasional footnotes and explanations in English), Contrastes can be used as either a basic text or a grammar reference. Explicitly written for English-speaking students, the organizing principle of Contrastes is to anticipate and address the unique set of questions and common confusions encountered by English speakers when learning French grammar.</p><p><p> <b><i>Contrastes</i></b> is a French grammar program that can be used as an integral part of an intermediate or advanced course or on its own as a reference grammar. It anticipates and provides answers to typical questions and common confusions encountered by English-speaking students. <b><i>Contrastes</i></b> is ideal for French language courses, study abroad programs, translation courses, senior seminars, and graduate courses in the teaching of French. </p> <b>KEY FEATURES:</b> <ul> <li>Contrastive approach clarifies the differences between similar French constructions and illuminates common mistakes.</li> <li>Clear examples are provided with idiomatic North American English translations.</li> <li>Nota Bene boxes draw students' attention to exceptions, contrasts, or common confusions.</li> <li>Verification exercises in the text allow students to confirm their understanding of key points and to work independently.</li> </ul><p> <i>Contrastes: grammaire du francais courant</i> is a French grammar text geared specifically to English-speaking students. It can be used either as an integral part of an advanced or a high intermediate French language course, or on its own, as a reference grammar. <i>Contrastes</i> is meant for those who have already acquired a good foundation in French (through contextual or communicative approaches), but who need a thorough review of grammar as they move to the next level of proficiency. It should be of particular use to students planning to study abroad. It is also designed for instructors who prefer to use a traditional grammar textbook in tandem with their own choice of cultural materials, composition books, and/or literary materials or readers, rather than to rely on a single manual in which grammar, literature, and culture come as a prepackaged unit. </p> <p> <i>Contrastes</i> is written in French, with occasional footnote explanations in English. Although the treatment of grammar is by no means definitive or exhaustive, it covers areas that are most confusing for English speakers, and directly addresses their unique set of questions. Related and/or confusing structures within the French language are clarified through a wealth of contrasting examples that also help to emphasize the syntactical differences between French and English. <i>Contrastes</i> further illuminates the more vexing grammatical issues by illustrating (in strike-through style) the most common mistakes and by explaining how to avoid them; students can therefore learn better how to self-correct. All examples are accompanied by idiomatic American English translations. These are meant to provide both clarity and efficiency and to ensure that unknown vocabulary does not stand in the way of the learning process, especially for students at the intermediate level or for those who are using <i>Contrastes</i> simply as a reference grammar. These translations also offer the opportunity to review, reinforce, and expand useful, day-to-day vocabulary. </p> <p><b>Pedagogical Features</b></p> <ul> <li><b><i>Twenty independent chapters.</i></b> These can be studied in any order, according to students' needs and course levels. Each chapter is organized in a progression that is coherent yet flexible. Undoubtedly, some chapters will take longer to study than others, especially the more challenging ones that have been placed in the second part of the book. (The difficulty of any given chapter is, of course, a matter of individual assessment.)</li> <li><b><i>Grammatical points</i></b> are clearly numbered for easy reference, so they can be studied in various sequences, depending on students' abilities. Asterisks mark more advanced or complex topics or issues within each chapter, allowing teachers and learners to tailor the textbook to their own pedagogical approach or needs.</li> <li><b><i>Nota Bene,</i></b> explicitly numbered and titled, also help draw attention to exceptions, contrasts, or common confusions.</li> <li><b><i>Tableaux synthetiques</i></b> allow students to grasp key information at a glance. Generous lists of frequently used verbs, helpful vocabulary, and familiar idiomatic expressions are provided within the body of the text (rather than in appendices), and make for easier learning and retention. Explanations using basic grammatical terminology are given in accurate yet accessible French.</li> <li><b><i>Autrement dit.</i></b> For more difficult issues, however, <i>Contrastes</i> provides a few footnote explanations in English. These are meant especially for intermediate students, who should not have to struggle to get the point, and for those wishing to use <i>Contrastes</i> as a reference grammar.</li> <li><b><i>Short verification exercises</i></b> (with answer keys at the back of the book) have been placed strategically within each chapter; they are designed to help students to master key concepts and rules and to build their confidence as they move from simple to more complex structures.</li> <li><b><i>Accompanying Workbook.</i></b> This supplement closely follows the presentation of each chapter and provides opportunity for additional practice. Exercises (with answer keys at the end of the book) move from basic to more advanced structures, from "fill in the blanks" to open-ended sentences, culminating in short English/French translations and compositions. More challenging exercises are marked by an asterisk so that instructors may choose assignments according to the level and strength of their students. A number of exercises require oral or written work with a partner, and thus can easily be used as an in-class activity.</li> </ul></p><h2>A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy (Graz Schumpeter Lectures)</h2><p><p><b>Why Enlightenment culture sparked the Industrial Revolution</b></p><p>During the late eighteenth century, innovations in Europe triggered the Industrial Revolution and the sustained economic progress that spread across the globe. While much has been made of the details of the Industrial Revolution, what remains a mystery is why it took place at all. Why did this revolution begin in the West and not elsewhere, and why did it continue, leading to today's unprecedented prosperity? In this groundbreaking book, celebrated economic historian Joel Mokyr argues that a culture of growth specific to early modern Europe and the European Enlightenment laid the foundations for the scientific advances and pioneering inventions that would instigate explosive technological and economic development. Bringing together economics, the history of science and technology, and models of cultural evolution, Mokyr demonstrates that culture&#x2015;the beliefs, values, and preferences in society that are capable of changing behavior&#x2015;was a deciding factor in societal transformations.</p><p>Mokyr looks at the period 1500&#x2013;1700 to show that a politically fragmented Europe fostered a competitive "market for ideas" and a willingness to investigate the secrets of nature. At the same time, a transnational community of brilliant thinkers known as the &#x201c;Republic of Letters&#x201d; freely circulated and distributed ideas and writings. This political fragmentation and the supportive intellectual environment explain how the Industrial Revolution happened in Europe but not China, despite similar levels of technology and intellectual activity. In Europe, heterodox and creative thinkers could find sanctuary in other countries and spread their thinking across borders. In contrast, China&#x2019;s version of the Enlightenment remained controlled by the ruling elite.</p><p>Combining ideas from economics and cultural evolution, <i>A Culture of Growth</i> provides startling reasons for why the foundations of our modern economy were laid in the mere two centuries between Columbus and Newton.</p></p><p><p>"Many great minds have written many great books about why Europe spearheaded technological progress and economic growth in the past three centuries. Joel Mokyr has joined their ranks with admirable verve, erudition, and originality. In his account, a change in the beliefs, values, and preferences of Europeans drove them to accumulate, share, and apply knowledge as it had never been done before. Agree or disagree with Mokyr's thesis, you definitely need to take it seriously."<b>--Margaret Jacob, University of California, Los Angeles</b></p><p>"<i>A Culture of Growth</i>is an insightful quest into the economic history of the last five centuries. Mokyr's historical laboratory is early modern Europe, when a small mass of highly skilled artisans, entrepreneurs, financiers and merchants laid the roots of what was to become the Industrial Revolution."<b>--Angus Deaton, 2015 Nobel Laureate in Economics</b></p><p>"Mokyr's new masterpiece is a virtuoso display of how new thinking in economics can bring a deeper understanding of one of the most important events in human history.<i>A Culture of Growth</i>documents the cultural shifts that permitted the interrogation of nature that then flowered into scientific advances. This book offers us an optimistic vision: a great expansion of communication preceded our modern prosperity, and we can expect this to happen again."<b>--Robert E. Lucas Jr., 1995 Nobel Laureate in Economics</b></p><p>"In this immensely learned book, Mokyr argues that a specific culture of growth anchored in the Republic of Letters, spread through the enlightened circuits beginning with Britain, and made the Industrial Revolution happen. Written by America's leading economic historian,<i>A Culture of Growth</i>is magisterial and long overdue."<b>Margaret Jacob, University of California, Los Angeles</b></p><p>"A giant among the masters of economic history, Mokyr has written a brilliant, persuasive, humane, penetrating, and sensationally good book. Mokyr looks at the immensely powerful idea of a progressive Baconian science, which stepped down from theory to enrich the modern world. The range of scholarship is astonishing and this major work will become a standard in the literature on economic growth."<b>--Daron Acemoglu, coauthor of<i>Why Nations Fail</i></b></p><p>"[Mokyr] reminds us that the skirmishing of philosophers and their ideas, the preoccupation of popular historians, is in many ways a sideshow--that the revolution that gave Europe dominance was, above all, scientific, and that the scientific revolution was, above all, an artisanal revolution."<b>--Diane Coyle,<i>Financial Times</i></b></p><p>"One has to admire the depth of knowledge and the subtlety of Mokyr's argument.... For serious students of the Enlightenment itself, Mokyr's magnum opus will be required reading for a long time to come."<b>--Arnold Kling,<i>Econlib</i></b></p><b>Joel Mokyr</b> is the Robert H.

The second part of the book introduces manifolds and differential forms, providing the framework for proofs of the n-dimensional version of Stokes&#39; theorem and of the poincare lemma. The final chapter discusses abstract manifolds. At the end of each section is a set of exercises. Some are computational and some are theoretical.</p><p></p><h2>Dieter Rams. Less But Better</h2><p>The new edition of the benchmark work originally published by the Dieter and Ingeborg Rams Foundation and Jo Klatt. Few product designs have the staying power of creations by Dieter Rams. Almost everything produced by one of the most influential designers of the twentieth century is today considered a classic. This new and revised edition of Less but Better shows once again why Dieter Rams&#x2019;s approach to design will be relevant for the foreseeable future Ideas of what can and must be achieved by good design are in a constant state of flux as a result of cultural and technological developments. Dieter Rams, however, came up with ten principles that advocate for a purist, almost imperceptible design. These principles are still considered timeless fundaments of design theory and practice today: Good design is innovative. Good design makes a product useful. Good design is aesthetic. Good design helps a product to be understood. Good design is unobtrusive. Good design is honest. Good design is durable. Good design is consistent to the last detail. Good design is environmentally friendly. Good design is as little design as possible. Less but Better does not set out to be a complete documentation of Dieter Rams&#x2019;s body of work, nor does it claim to tell the full story of the company Braun. Rather, the book explores the ideas, criteria, and methods behind Rams&#x2019;s creations and reveals how a shifting culture of product manufacturing gave rise to universal design benchmarks. From his reflections on design ethics and values we can distill a clear paradigm for future design &#x2015;because one principle has remained firm over the years: less is simply better.</p><p></p><h2>An Investigation of the Laws of Thought</h2><p>"A classic of pure mathematics and symbolic logic ... the publisher is to be thanked for making it available." &#x2014; <i>Scientific American<br></i>George Boole was on of the greatest mathematicians of the 19th century, and one of the most influential thinkers of all time. Not only did he make important contributions to differential equations and calculus of finite differences, he also was the discoverer of invariants, and the founder of modern symbolic logic. According to Bertrand Russell, "Pure mathematics was discovered by George Boole in his work published in 1854."<br>This work is the first extensive statement of the modern view that mathematics is a pure deductive science that can be applied to various situations. Boole first showed how classical logic could be treated with algebraic terminology and operations, and then proceeded to a general symbolic method of logical interference; he also attempted to devise a calculus of probabilities which could be applied to situations hitherto considered beyond investigation.<br>The enormous range of this work can be seen from chapter headings: Nature and Design of This Work; Signs and Their Laws; Derivation of Laws; Division of Propositions; Principles of Symbolical Reasoning; Interpretation; Elimination; Reduction; Methods of Abbreviation; Conditions of a Perfect Method; Secondary Propositions; Methods in Secondary Propositions; Clarke and Spinoza; Analysis, Aristotelian Logic; Theory of Probabilities; General Method in Probabilities; Elementary Illustrations; Statistical Conditions; Problems on Causes; Probability of Judgments; Constitution of the Intellect. This last chapter, Constitution of the Intellect, is a very significant analysis of the psychology of discovery and scientific method.</p><p>George Boole, the father of Boolean algebra, published An Investigation of the Laws of Thought, a seminal work on algebraic logic, in 1854. In this investigation of the fundamental laws of human reasoning, Boole uses the symbolic language of mathematics to examine the nature of the human mind.George Boole (2 November 1815 &#x2013; 8 December 1864) was an English mathematician, philosopher and logician. He worked in the fields of differential equations and algebraic logic, and is now best known as the author of The Laws of Thought. Boole said, &#x2018;...no general method for the solution of questions in the theory of probabilities can be established which does not explicitly recognise ... those universal laws of thought which are the basis of all reasoning.&#x2019;</p><h2>Quiet Light</h2><p>Fifty-one exquisite b&amp;w plates by a fine photographer who is an obvious student of Ansel Adams.

Chapters open with a scenario involving real-life students to connect abstract chemical concepts to students' lives. Math is introduced on a need-to-know basis. This conceptual approach first teaches the chemistry and then shows students how to use the math with the chemistry. We recognize how important it is for students to apply chemistry to their world and have added or expanded applications - especially medical- and environment-related applications - throughout the text, marginal notes, worked examples, and end-of-chapter problems.<br>�Consider This features offer conceptual-in-nature questions at the end of worked examples. These questions prompt students to extend their understanding beyond the focus of the worked examples.&nbsp;�Key Concepts replace end-of-chapter summaries. Presented in outline form, they guide student discovery of the most important ideas discussed in each chapter.�Concept Review multiple-choice questions have been added to end-of-chapter questions and problems. Because most students in an introductory chemistry course will take multiple-choice exams, these questions provide them with an outstanding practice opportunity. The conceptual nature of these questions helps students develop deeper understanding and critical thinking skills. After each question, a follow-up question provides additional practice with the analysis of multiple-choice responses.�Four new elements have been named in the Revised Periodic Table: nihonium (Nh, element 113), moscovium (Mc, 115), tennessine (Ts, 117), and oganesson (Og, 118).�The Art Program is considered the best in the market. To help students connect verbal descriptions to molecular-level representations, the program uses symbols and zoomed-in art to show critical phenomena at a molecular level.&nbsp;�The problem-solving approach is supported by worked Example Boxes. Problem solving in chemistry is much more than algorithmic number crunching. It involves applying principles to solve problems. Conceptual problems require students to apply their understanding of concepts instead of just an algorithm. This text emphasizes underlying concepts when discussing numerical problems within in-chapter worked examples as well as end-of-chapter problems.<br>The best approach to incorporating math involves development of associated math on an as-needed basis, with an emphasis on concepts that the problems are trying to illustrate. This text integrates need-to-know mathematical ideas that are important to chemists into conceptual discussions.&nbsp;�Math Toolboxes have been reworked and expanded, and now include accompanying end-of-chapter problems.&nbsp;�Toolbox Icons in the text margins point students to the appropriate review material.&nbsp;�The math reviews provided in the end-of-chapter Math Toolboxes are referenced within appropriate sections of the text.<br>New or enhanced electronic methods to access the material include the ReadAnywhere app that allows students to access their ebook on mobile devices. Once chapters are downloaded, students can use the same tools available in the ebook, and notes and highlights will sync across platforms. The LearnSmart adaptive diagnostic learning system and Heat Maps constantly assess data to determine students' knowledge of the material, time spent answering questions, and percentage of correct answers. These features enable students to develop a strategically timed personal learning path adapted to what they have actively learned and retained. LearnSmart lets the instructor see exactly what students have accomplished and includes a built-in assessment tool for graded assignments.</p><p>Richard Bauer completed his B.S. in chemistry at Saginaw Valley State University (Michigan) and his M.A. and Ph.D. in chemistry education at Purdue University.

This book focuses on the collaborative effort required to complete any public or private construction project, providing the construction professional with the skills needed to work with and alongside the owner representative, the designer, and within the public's eye. It explains in detail the project elements and environment, and the responsibilities of the varied project professionals, and follows in detail the chronology of a project.</p><p><p> <b>Professor Gould</b> is the Ahlborg Professor of Construction Management at Roger Williams University where he serves as the director of the Construction Management Program.&nbsp; He has over 20 years of teaching experience at the university level.&nbsp; His expertise lies in the field of Construction Project Management, Estimating, Scheduling and Project Control.&nbsp; He has authored two textbooks in these fields.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In addition to his teaching, he actively consults in the field having worked with a wide range of public and private clients including the U.S. Air Force, Sears Roebuck, and NASA.&nbsp; He has developed and taught numerous seminar and short courses in both public and in-house settings.&nbsp; He has served as a seminar instructor for R.S.

(ACCE) where he has serves on the board of directors and as chair of the Guidance committee.&nbsp; ACCE is the organization that accredits Construction Management Programs.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>Ms. Joyce </b>has over 30 years experience in the design and construction industry with a concentration on academic and cultural environments.&nbsp; She has served in the past in project management roles, focusing on teams, processes and strategic planning.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past five years, she has overseen the development of over $500 Million in higher education and museum programs, designs and construction.&nbsp; She is presently working as a construction consultant on a large museum project in Canada.</p><p> Over the past several years, the construction industry has seen enormous changes. From an industry steeped in conservative practices and narrowly scoped services, construction has moved to the forefront of the design and construction profession. From general contracting to construction management to project management and program management, the methods of servicing the industry have evolved to be more varied and comprehensive. This requires that practitioners and students alike understand the many aspects of the world of owners, designers, tenants, regulatory agencies, community agencies, and subcontractors. Each participant brings political, professional, and personal motivations to the process, and each has the ability to place constraints on the project. To effectively navigate in this environment, the successful project manager must recognize the role of each participant, understand the nature of the project itself, and effectively use management tools to bring the project forward in a timely and cost-effective manner. </p> <p> In addition to contending with the nature of each project and the individual participants, the project manager also has his or her own organization to navigate as well as those of the owner and designer. As the major participants in any project, these organizations can support or hinder the process, depending on the fit between a particular organization and the project as well as the fit among the individual organizations. The recipe for success is indeed a complicated one. This book looks at the forms of organizations and some of the dynamics at play in them, and it outlines some methods for putting the right people and right organization together for a specific project. </p> <p><b>SCOPE OF THE TEXT</b></p> <p> To address all of the aspects that a successful project manager will need to understand, this text is organized to explore the people involved in the design and construction process, the principal phases of a project, and the tools required to effectively manage the people and the project. It is intended primarily for students in a four-year construction management curriculum serving as an in-depth introduction to construction project management. The book will also benefit undergraduate or graduate civil engineering or architectural students who desire to better understand the construction process. It is also intended to be used by older students or practitioners who are looking for an understanding of the changes in the industry and new tools and management methods available for dealing with those changes. </p> <p><b>INSTRUCTIONAL TECHNIQUE</b></p> <p> People learn in many different ways. While most people are able to absorb lessons through the written text, the concepts being presented can be reinforced through other media. To that end, this book presents material in many different forms. The text is the major method employed, but the book also uses charts, illustrations, photos, and anecdotal sidebars. In addition, this book is coauthored by an academic and by an industry professional. That combination fuses theory and practical reality in dynamic interchange. Understanding of pedagogy and how people learn is teamed with the understanding of what information practitioners need to be successful in an increasingly competitive environment. In addition, many of the sidebars are authored by industry leaders, lending more real-world perspective to the book. </p> <p><b>ORGANIZATION OF THE TEXT</b></p> <p> The book is divided into three sections. The first section examines the industry and the profession by looking at the nature of the industry, future trends, and opportunities. It outlines the different sectors of the industry, explains the role of each participant, and analyzes the variety of contractual arrangements available for particular projects. The second section focuses on the project itself, giving an in-depth overview of all aspects of the project from the very first concept to occupancy. This section emphasizes the role of the construction professional during the design process. This emphasis reflects the actual expansion in early participation of the construction professional. The third section focuses on the tools needed to manage the people and the project. Estimating and scheduling are two of the major tools used in construction management, but these tools must be combined with methods of control to ensure that an effective feedback system is established throughout the project. This section also examines what it takes to bring a project to completion, exploring the world of project administration with its documentation, procedures, and communication protocols. Lastly, a chapter on safety explains the importance of a good safety program to the financial and environmental health of the company and workers. </p> <p> The appendix provides a list of websites containing valuable construction-related information. </p> <p> Throughout this text, the roles of the owners, the designers, and the construction professional are interwoven. For a project to enjoy first-rate success, these three major participants have to be in perfect alignment with each other. Throughout the project, they each contribute to the project in a very specific way. To be in perfect alignment they have to understand specifically each other's contribution, believe in its essential worth, and learn how to support each other for the mutual benefit of a successful project. The project manager is the key to creating an atmosphere where this support can be nurtured. This book gives project managers the tools that are essential to this task. </p> <p><b>SECOND EDITION</b></p> <p> This second edition of the book includes two new chapters: </p> <ul> <li>Chapter 3 examines the organizational and leadership qualities needed to bring people together for successful delivery of a construction project. Some material that was in Chapter 8 of the first edition now appears in Chapter 3 of the second edition.</li> <li>Chapter 13 is an introduction to construction law. Two attorneys who specialize in construction law prepared this chapter. Both of these lawyers are actively pursuing new methods of establishing the legal tools needed to support innovative project teaming. Some of these tools are explored in this chapter.</li> </ul></p><h2>The Common Reader: First Series, Annotated Edition</h2><p>Woolf&#x2019;s first and most popular volume of essays.

At a fraction of the price, the Shorter offers much of the same content, and provides the same quality of lexical excellence as its parent dictionary. <br>No other dictionary comes close to the Shorter's range and depth. It offers over 500,000 definitions covering virtually every word or phrase in use in the English language--worldwide--since 1700. Each entry identifies a word's various meanings, origins, part of speech, pronunciation, and presents combinations in which the word is often found as well as cross-references to related words. The Shorter offers a historical and literary approach made famous by the OED, which no competitor can match. <br>Now with 2,500 new words and meanings based on the ongoing research program of Oxford Dictionaries and the Oxford English Corpus, the Shorter is fresher than ever. Some of the new words included in this edition are; Afrobeat, carbon-neutral, darknet, heaviosity, impactful, knuckle-dragger, nanomaterial, retro-futurist, smoosh, testosteronic, webinar, and thousands more. Also new to this edition is a never-before-published, introductory essay by language commentator David Crystal on the History of English providing stimulating insight into the development of the English language.</p><p>In hardcover it takes up two thick volumes, but on CD-ROM you get the same 7.5 million words of text (with half a million definitions and 83,000 quotations) on a thin compact disc. The computerized <i>New SOED</i> is a great pleasure. It readily accomplishes the simple task of looking up a word, providing definition, usage, and simple etymology. But the program also searches by anagram and by rhyme, by quotation and by etymology. Perusing the headword group is like flipping the pages. In this fashion, I ran across "nesh" (soft--in consistency, mind, or morals), "convell" (refute completely) and "xoanon" (primitive carved statue of a deity). My Scrabble game is getting less nesh all the time. <i>--Stephanie Gold</i>William R.

It forms the foundations of government, sociology, psychology, history, religion, and the many disciplines that study how people live and work together, influencing each other. It can be intriguing, because power can be surprisingly complex. It can be enticing, because power can be seductive. But it can also inspire and uplift and exalt, because power can be used to help people accomplish marvelous things.<br><br>What feelings do you have when you think about power? To some, power means control. To be powerful may feel heady, exhilarating, exciting. Some feel strong with it and impotent without it; invincible with it and vulnerable without it; comfortable with it or scared by it. Some feel that to have power is bad, that power itself is bad. Didn't Lord Acton insightfully observe that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely? Others feel it is desirable or even essential for successful living. But power is not really good or bad; it is neutral. Power itself is not negative or positive, although our feelings about it may be. Power is the potential to influence others for good or evil, to be a blessing or a scourge. Like nuclear energy, it can provide the electricity to light a city, or it can fuel the bomb that destroys it.<br><br>You might not think of it as such, but power pervades every aspect of your life. You wield it and are subject to it. This is because we are all interconnected. We live together, work together, shop together, worship together, and play together. In all these settings, we are with other people whose feelings, views, desires, goals, and values may be different from ours. When we come together, it is natural that we influence and are influenced by each other. Power is our ability to influence one another.<br><br><b>WHO IS POWERFUL?</b><br><br>So who among us is powerful? How do we define power between individuals? If you're like most people, you know power when you see it, but you can't really define it. We seem to have an innate ability to measure power in our fellow man. An exercise I often perform with organizations illustrates this point. I've gone into companies and other groups with this request, "Here's a personnel roster -- rank these people in terms of their power." With no more than this single instruction, people have no difficulty completing the task. Although there is some disagreement about the ranking of those in the middle, most people readily agree on who really has power. In fact, what I often find is that everyone agrees who's at the top and bottom of the list. People seem to sense who is powerful. I find this agreement whether I am asking about power at work, power in politics, power in the community, or power in families -- wherever people are together.<br><br>A group of automotive engineers testing the horsepower of an engine would be expected to concur on how powerful the engine is. Since we don't have physical instruments for measuring interpersonal power, what is it that causes this agreement when people are asked to rank the more powerful and less powerful people they associate with? I believe it is our perceptions, based on our experiences -- we feel it. When I ask people about those they know who they consider to be powerful, they often explain the source of their power in terms of an instance in which the powerful person played a significant role. This frequently includes some reference to the kind of relationships the powerful person has. For example, one might say, "Enrico is so powerful -- he gets anything he wants because people are afraid of him." Or, "Suzanne is pretty powerful -- she has what others want, and the only way they can get it is to go through her." Or, "I'd say that Chris has power with other people and they choose to follow him because they trust him -- they believe in what he is trying to accomplish."<br><br>Reflect on your own experience. Do you know a powerful person? This might be someone you have worked with, someone you have lived with, or some historical or current public figure you have read about. However you define power, this person has it. What makes others choose to follow this person?<br><br><b>THREE PATHS TO POWER</b><br><br>There are three options you should consider. First, is it because they are afraid not to? Perhaps this person has the capacity, authority, or ability to intimidate or bully people, to do something unpleasant or uncomfortable <i>to</i> other people. Is this person powerful because they can hurt others in some way, or embarrass them, humiliate them, impose sanctions against them, fire them, or take something away from them? If they are afraid that this powerful person can do something they don't like, others might comply just to avoid the problem. With fear as a source of this person's power, others might go along to get along.<br><br>Consider a second option. This person might be influential with others because of what they can do <i>for</i> them. This person has the capacity to do something that other people want. For example, they might offer one of the following: "I will pay you if you'll do what I want. I have something to exchange for your time and effort. I can give you information. I can give you opportunity. I can give you resources. I can give you power. I've got something you want, you've got something I want. Let's make a deal." This person has power because they can provide things that other people want, in order to get what they want in return. This is different from the first kind of power. There is no threat or force involved. Ask yourself, Is this second option the reason why people choose to follow the individual that I was thinking about? Is there something valuable they offer to do <i>for</i> them in exchange?<br><br>A third option represents an entirely different approach and a different kind of power. This category suggests that the person you believe is powerful is someone others believe in, someone they honor, someone they respect. They comply with this person's wishes because they want what she wants. Whether she is there or checking up on them or paying them does not matter. She believes in them and they believe in her. As a consequence, people willingly and wholeheartedly give themselves to what she asks of them. This person has power with others, not over them.<br><br>It may seem artificial to divide your analysis this way. Perhaps the reasons people choose to follow the person you are thinking about fall into more than one category. Or perhaps the reasons people choose for following or listening or paying attention vary over time. The important thing is that you think about a real person and the possible reasons why they are powerful, why others choose to follow them.<br><br><i>WHEN ARE YOU POWERFUL?</i><br><br>Now consider a different situation. We all recognize power in others, but are you prepared to recognize it in yourself? Think about a situation in which <i>you</i> were the powerful person, where your influence was significant with a group of people during the past year in your personal life or your professional life. Whether formally or informally, you were recognized as the leader -- they chose to follow you.<br><br>Recall a time in your life when you felt particularly powerful. Maybe you made a brilliant presentation or closed a major deal. Maybe you got a group of Boy Scouts to behave on a camping trip, solved a family dispute, or talked your way out of a potential problem. Maybe you were initiating a new activity or product, installing a new system at work, collecting money for a worthy cause in your own neighborhood, changing a program or policy at your children's school, or working to accomplish something for your community.<br><br>Think of a specific setting, and a specific group of people that you influenced. In relation to that group, particular project, or endeavor, why did they choose to follow you? Why did they listen to you? Why were you influential with them? Consider the same three options for this analysis as you did for the person you recalled earlier.<br><br>Which of the three types of power was most characteristic of you in the situation you recalled? It is possible that there was some combination. There seems to be a continuum of power, from feeling that we can do anything, to compromising, to demanding, to feeling that there is nothing we can do. But it is also likely that one of the three dominates the others in your interpersonal dealings, whether at work or at home. When you ask yourself these questions, you might realize that the way you handled a particular situation was not the only way available to you. In some instances, you might explore your options and move from one type of power to the next. Perhaps you use love and kindness, but when that falls short, you resort to bargaining. If bargaining fails, you might be reduced to threats. Maybe you even give up.<br><br>What parent hasn't experienced this cycle with a child? A friend told me of such an instance that occurred when she was toilet training her son. Her first attempts at persuasion entailed kindness and understanding. She explained how proud she and his father would be if he managed to fill the toilet rather than his diaper. He refused to listen. In a second futile attempt, she explained to him how the earth would move and the angels would sing if he could only achieve this goal. All the child could say was, "No, no, no."<br><br>She thought his smug two-year-old grin of self-amusement and satisfaction would drive her to the brink, but she maintained her composure. "How about you go on the potty, and I'll give you three marshmallows!" His response was laughable. "I don't want to go on the potty. Give me some marshmallows!" His demands continued for a matter of minutes, drowning out her pleas, and she finally broke. "All right, mister. You go on the potty or I'm going to lock you in your room and you'll never have another marshmallow as long as you live." Needless to say, this approach failed as dismally as had the first two, and the child ended up running into the bedroom, where he screamed, with the door closed.<br><br>Though many of the situations we face may seem more important at the time than a confrontation with a temperamental two-year-old, we can learn some valuable lessons from this woman's experience. First, we always have a choice. Second, crisis plus time equals humor. It may be funny to look at this situation from a distance of miles and years. Most of us manage to arrive at adulthood having been potty trained somewhere along the way. But at the time, the confrontation between what we want and what another person wants can feel pretty intense.<br><br><b>HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT POWER?</b><br><br>If you feel that you could have more influence with others, that you could be more effective, whether it be with a child or a boss, you are not alone. Here are some revealing comments from participants in a public seminar I recently conducted. I asked the question "How do you feel about the power and influence you have with the people in your life?"<br><br>A career executive with two preschoolers at home agonizes, "I don't feel like I am raising my own children. My influence with them is minimal. I try, and we have the best help we can get, but my kids don't seem to want to do anything I want them to do."<br><br>A manager in a small company protests, "All these new hires have such high expectations of us, but they are unwilling to commit, unwilling to learn, unwilling to get on board. They don't seem interested in doing the job that has to be done. In the old days, it was easy -- 'No work, no job.' But now there are threats of litigation. Everybody has more rights than we do, yet we are somehow supposed to achieve quality, continuous improvement, and reduced costs. What can I do?"<br><br>Each of the comments you just read describes a dilemma. The individual is stuck and feels they do not have the power and influence they want. Although their concerns are legitimate, their beliefs are preventing them from seeing a way out.<br><br><i>THERE IS ALWAYS A PATH TO POWER</i><br><br>No matter how frustrated you may feel, there is always a way out. In every situation that arises, we choose to be powerful or powerless. It may not always feel like it, but it is a choice. And there are consequences for these choices in terms of the results that we get, and the subsequent increase or decrease in our power and influence. If we choose powerlessness, it is often because we doubt there is any other option. Powerless choices can lead to lose/win relationships, irresponsibility, stagnation, immobility, and despair. In this book I will show you that powerlessness need not be a part of your life. Even those among us who seem to have no power can become very powerful.<br><br>Based on interviews and my own research, I've characterized what I call the power process, which describes the dynamic relationship between people as they attempt to influence each other.<br><br><i>IT ALL STARTS WITH YOU</i><br><br>The power process starts with you. From my perspective, when I look at power and the choices that people make, it seems like it <i>all</i> starts with you. When I say you, I'm thinking about you in some very specific ways -- your skills, your future, your past, and your character. When you encounter a new situation, you've got a certain skill set. You may have sought out that situation or it may have come to you unsolicited. The skills that you have enable you to do the job. Your skills are the things that you can do right now in the present.<br><br>In addition to the skills that you have, you have a capacity to develop or acquire new talents and gifts. Your capacity has to do with the skills that you will have in the future. You have a lot of potential, a lot of possibilities within you.<br><br>You also have a history. Your history is a record of where you have been and what you have done. You have dealt with people in certain ways, ways that have resulted in various outcomes with them in the past. You may have found that even with new assignments people already have feelings and ideas about you. Perhaps they've heard something about you; your history has preceded you. You may carry that history and its effects with you for a long time. Sometimes our history feels like ankle irons. It keeps us from being effective right now because of something that happened in the past.<br><br>Sometimes we have to outlive our history. You might have read <i>The Scarlet Letter</i> by Nathaniel Hawthorne. The heroine of the book, Hester Prynne, was caught in adultery and confessed without naming her partner. Beyond her public humiliation and ostracism, as a part of her punishment she had to sew a large letter "A," to represent the word "Adulteress," on all her clothing. She was made to do this so that everyone in the community would know what kind of person she was. Well, she outlived it. She raised her daughter as a single parent. She lived a quiet life as best she could, working for others and giving back to the community in small ways. Because of the service she rendered, the compassionate giving that she came to be known for, little children growing up a decade later in that community asked their parents if the prominent "A" on her clothing stood for "Angel."<br><br>In addition to our history, we also have character. Character is what we are. You have an internal set of beliefs, motivations, desires, and principles that are manifested by your behavior. Together they comprise your character. Leadership, power, and influence are about what you are and what you can do, your capabilities and your character. They're both important. But what you are speaks so loudly, the saying goes, others often can't hear what you are saying.<br><br>...</p><h2>Inside Degrees: Developing Your Soul Biography Using the Chandra Symbols (Inside Astrology)</h2><p>In much the same way in which he characterized planets and asteroids as powerful, gendered beings in <i>Inside Planets</i>, Ellias Lonsdale gives new depth and nuance to degree analysis, an area often seen as technical or reduced to cliche. The degree symbols are most useful in elaborating a personal birth chart. One can learn about personal cycles from studying the place of a transiting or progressed planet by degree at a given time, revealing collective as well as personal timings.<br><br>The Zodiac degrees also act as an oracle. One can open the collection anywhere for a given day, or in response to a question. The degrees will reveal what is happening now and, if we are attentive and responsive to the cues, what is required of us. By comparing charts of friends and famous people who are known for certain qualities, one can gradually discriminate among the degrees. These beautifully written and fully imagined readings of the Chandra degree symbols speak to a deep level of personal change and authenticity.</p><p>Ellias Lonsdale is the author of <i>Star Rhythms</i>, <i>The Book of Theanna</i>, and <i>Inside Planets</i>.

Drawing on his remarkable powers of observation and deduction, coupled with an encyclopedic knowledge of crimes and criminals, Holmes seeks out his prey in the London underworld, where no evildoer is safe from his keen wits and tenacious pursuit.<br>Reprinted from a standard text, this inexpensive volume offers mystery lovers a choice selection of six of the finest Sherlock Holmes stories: "A Scandal in Bohemia," "The Red-headed League," "The Adventure of the Speckled Band," "The Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb," "The Final Problem," and "The Adventure of the Empty House." In these richly atmospheric stories, Victorian London comes vividly to life as hansom cabs clatter over the cobblestoned streets, gas lamps flare in the thick fog, and an almost palpable sense of excitement seizes the reader as Holmes and Dr. Watson set off on another adventure.</p><p>Arthur Conan Doyle was a prolific writer born in Scotland who started out as a medical doctor.

It explores the building of stochastic (statistical) models for time series and their use in important areas of application --forecasting, model specification, estimation, and checking, transfer function modeling of dynamic relationships, modeling the effects of intervention events, and process control.A modernized new edition of one of the most trusted books on time series analysis. Since publication of the first edition in 1970, Time Series Analysis has served as one of the most influential and prominent works on the subject. This new edition maintains its balanced presentation of the tools for modeling and analyzing time series and also introduces the latest developments that have occurred n the field over the past decade through applications from areas such as business, finance, and engineering. <p>The Fourth Edition provides a clearly written exploration of the key methods for building, classifying, testing, and analyzing stochastic models for time series as well as their use in five important areas of application: forecasting; determining the transfer function of a system; modeling the effects of intervention events; developing multivariate dynamic models; and designing simple control schemes. Along with these classical uses, modern topics are introduced through the book's new features, which include:</p> <ul> <li> A new chapter on multivariate time series analysis, including a discussion of the challenge that arise with their modeling and an outline of the necessary analytical tools </li> <li> New coverage of forecasting in the design of feedback and feedforward control schemes </li> <li> A new chapter on nonlinear and long memory models, which explores additional models for application such as heteroscedastic time series, nonlinear time series models, and models for long memory processes </li> <li> Coverage of structural component models for the modeling, forecasting, and seasonal adjustment of time series </li> <li> A review of the maximum likelihood estimation for ARMA models with missing values </li> </ul> <p>Numerous illustrations and detailed appendices supplement the book,while extensive references and discussion questions at the end of each chapter facilitate an in-depth understanding of both time-tested and modern concepts. With its focus on practical, rather than heavily mathematical, techniques, time Series Analysis, Fourth Edition is the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. this book is also an invaluable reference for applied statisticians, engineers, and financial analysts.</p></p><h2>How to Read a Poem: Based on the Billy Collins Poem &#34;Introduction to Poetry&#34;: (Field Guide Series)</h2><p>How to read a poem. A lot of books want to teach you just that. How is this one different?<p></p> Think of it less as an instructional book and more as an invitation. For the reader new to poetry, this guide will open your senses to the combined craft and magic known as "poems". For the well versed, if you will, this book might make you fall in love again.<p></p> <i>How to Read a Poem</i> uses images like the mouse, the hive, the switch (from the Billy Collins poem "Introduction to Poetry")&#x2014;to guide readers into new ways of understanding poems. Excellent teaching tool. Anthology included.</p><p><b>Tania Runyan</b> is an editor for <i>Every Day Poems</i> and the author of four books of poetry, including <i>A Thousand Vessels</i> and <i>Simple Weight.</i> Her poems have appeared in many publications, including <i>Poetry, Atlanta Review, Nimrod,</i> and <i>Southern Poetry Review.</i> She received an NEA Literature fellowship in 2011.While this book says it&#x2019;s an invitation, it&#x2019;s really much more. It&#x2019;s a conversation&#x2014;between you (lucky reader), Tania Runyan (funny, helpful friend) and these poems (brilliantly brought to the table by Runyan). No reader, experienced or new to reading poems, will want to miss this winsome and surprising way into the rich, wonderful conversations that poetry makes possible. &#x2014;David Wright, Assistant Professor of English at Monmouth College, IL<br><br>Runyan expertly brings you into her world of approaching and interpreting poetry, which is both mysterious and ordered. I would recommend this book to anyone hoping to gain insight into poetry. Prepare to have your heart captured! &#x2014;Thomas Purnell, Licensed Professional Counselor<br><br>Having taught poetry in high schools for over twenty-five years, I&#x2019;ve grown tired of Intro-to-Poetry texts that feel they must overwhelm the student with the authors&#x2019; erudition or the art&#x2019;s storied history of technique. If there is truly a need for the news only poetry can deliver, then those tomes make dismal advertisements. Tania Runyan has broken with this flat tradition and, in affectionate conversation with the wit of Billy Collins, produced a model for engaging in discovery of poetry&#x2019;s value&#x2014;no prior book-learning or companion text required. Which is not to say her ambition is slight; she would thrill to see novices become lifelong readers, even passionate scholars of the art and poets themselves, but she gets it. Her book reads like a playful love letter&#x2014;a creative intercession on poetry&#x2019;s behalf&#x2014;to the hearts of a new generation, those on whom so much, like the future of the art, depends. &#x2014;Brad Davis, Poet, teacher, and counselor at Pomfret School</p><h2>Marconi: The Man Who Networked the World</h2><p>A little over a century ago, the world went wireless. Cables and all their limiting inefficiencies gave way to a revolutionary means of transmitting news and information almost everywhere, instantaneously. By means of "Hertzian waves," as radio waves were initially known, ships could now make contact with other ships (saving lives, such as on the doomed <em>S.S. Titanic</em>); financial markets could coordinate with other financial markets, establishing the price of commodities and fixing exchange rates; military commanders could connect with the front lines, positioning artillery and directing troop movements. Suddenly and irrevocably, time and space telescoped beyond what had been thought imaginable. Someone had not only imagined this networked world but realized it: Guglielmo Marconi.<br><br>As Marc Raboy shows us in this enthralling and comprehensive biography, Marconi was the first truly global figure in modern communications. Born to an Italian father and an Irish mother, he was in many ways stateless, working his cosmopolitanism to advantage. Through a combination of skill, tenacity, luck, vision, and timing, Marconi popularized--and, more critically, patented--the use of radio waves. Soon after he burst into public view at the age of 22 with a demonstration of his wireless apparatus in London, 1896, he established his Wireless Telegraph &amp; Signal Company and seemed unstoppable. He was decorated by the Czar of Russia, named an Italian Senator, knighted by King George V of England, and awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics--all before the age of 40. Until his death in 1937, Marconi was at the heart of every major innovation in electronic communication, courted by powerful scientific, political, and financial interests. He established stations and transmitters in every corner of the globe, from Newfoundland to Buenos Aires, Hawaii to Saint Petersburg.<br><br>Based on original research and unpublished archival materials in four countries and several languages, Raboy's book is the first to connect significant parts of Marconi's story, from his early days in Italy, to his groundbreaking experiments, to his protean role in world affairs. Raboy also explores Marconi's relationshps with his wives, mistresses, and children, and examines in unsparing detail the last ten years of the inventor's life, when he returned to Italy and became a pillar of Benito Mussolini's fascist regime. Raboy's engrossing biography, which will stand as the authoritative work of its subject, proves that we still live in the world Marconi created.<br></p><p><br><strong>Marc Raboy </strong>is Beaverbrook Professor Emeritus in Ethics, Media, and Communications in the Department of Art History and Communication Studies at McGill University.<br><br>"Marc Raboy is an observant and sure-footed guide..."--Mary K.

The trial was itself the climax of a series of events which began two decades earlier (in 1613) and included another series of Inquisition proceedings in 1615-1616. Besides marking the end of the controversy that defines the original episode, the condemnation of 1633 also marks the beginning of another classic controversy-about the Galileo affair, its causes, its implications, and its lessons; about whether, for example, John Milton was right when in the Areopagitica he commented on his visit to Galileo in Florence by saying: "There it was that I found and visited the famous Galileo, grown old a prisoner to the Inquisition, for thinking in astronomy otherwise than the Franciscan and Dominican licensers thought." I happen to be extremely interested in this second story and second controversy, and a critical interpretation of the affair remains one of my ultimate goals. But that is not the subject of the present work, which is rather concerned with something more fundamental, namely with the documentation of the original episode.&nbsp;To be more exact, the aim of this book is to provide a documentary history of the series of developments which began in 1613 and culminated in 1633 with the trial and condemnation of Galileo. That is, it aims to provide a collection of the essential texts and documents containing information about both the key events and the key issues. The documents have been translated into English from the original languages, primarily Italian and partly Latin; they have been selected, are arranged, annotated, introduced, and otherwise edited with the following guiding principles in mind: to make the book as self-contained as possible and to minimize contentious interpretation and evaluation. The Galileo affair is such a controversial and important topic that one needs a sourcebook from which to learn firsthand about the events and the issues; since no adequate volume of the kind exists, this work attempts to fill the lacuna.&nbsp;The originals of the documents translated and collected here can all be found in printed sources. In fact, with one exception they are all contained in the twenty volumes of the National Edition of Galileo's works, edited by Antonio Favaro and first published in 1890-1909. The exception is the recently discovered "Anonymous Complaint About The Assayer," whose original was discovered and first published in 1983 by Pietro Redondi; this document is also contained in the critical edition of the Inquisition proceedings edited by Sergio M. Pagano and published in 1984 by the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. My selection was affected partly by the criterion of importance insofar as I chose documents that I felt to be (more or less) essential. Since I was also influenced by the double focus of this documentary history on events and issues, I therefore included two types of documents: the first consists of relatively short documents which are mostly either Inquisition proceedings (Chapters V and IX) or letters (Chapters I, VII, and VIII) and which primarily (though not exclusively) record various occurrences; the second type consists of longer essays by Galileo (Chapters II, Ill, IV, and VI) which discuss many of the central scientific and philosophical issues and have intrinsic importance independent of the affair. Finally, my goal of maximizing the autonomy of this volume suggested another reason for including some of these longer informative essays on the scientific issues (Chapters IV and VI).</p><p>&#x201c;A classic introduction to Galileo&#x2019;s masterpiece.&#x201d;&#x2014;William A.

Without meaning to, we constantly color-code children, segregating them by gender based on their presumed interests. Our social dependence on these norms has far-reaching effects, such as leading girls to dislike math or increasing aggression in boys.<br><br> In this practical guide, developmental psychologist (and mother of two) Christia Spears Brown uses science-based research to show how over-dependence on gender can limit kids, making it harder for them to develop into unique individuals. With a humorous, fresh, and accessible perspective, <i>Parenting Beyond Pink &amp; Blue</i> addresses all the issues that contemporary parents should consider&#x2014;from gender-segregated birthday parties and schools to sports, sexualization, and emotional intelligence. This guide empowers parents to help kids break out of pink&nbsp;and blue boxes to become their authentic selves.</p><p>CHRISTIA SPEARS BROWN, PhD, is an associate professor of developmental psychology at the University of Kentucky. Her work on the impact of gender stereotypes on children and adolescents has been published widely in scientific journals and featured in numerous newspapers, magazines, local radio shows, NPR, and the CBS Evening News. She blogs regularly for&nbsp;<i>Psychology Today</i>&nbsp;in her column "Beyond Pink and Blue." She is also an expert panelist for the ACLU.On Being the Weird Daughter-in-Law:<br><br> <b>I am the weird daughter-in-law.</b> I know it and have learned to embrace it. I first realized it when I overheard my sister-in-law whisper to my niece, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s put that away. Aunt Christy won&#x2019;t like it.&#x201d; She was right. It was one of those light-up mirrors that girls use when they pretend to put on makeup. This pink plastic mirror came with plastic makeup and hair care products&#x2014;and a voice. My skin crawled when it said, &#x201c;You sure look pretty with that makeup on&#x201d; or &#x201c;Wow, your hair looks great!&#x201d;<br><br> I quickly told my niece, who loves this makeup mirror, that I think she looks pretty all the time and that she is smart, funny, and interesting, which is even more important. Although I have no memory of it, my sister-in-law swears I took the batteries out of the mirror so that it couldn&#x2019;t talk anymore. I am not saying I didn&#x2019;t do it, and that is kind of my M.O.&#x2014;the subversive editing out of gender stereotypes.<br><br> I used to do this often, quietly undoing as many gender stereotypes as I could in my children&#x2019;s lives. After a while, I wasn&#x2019;t so quiet. In my house, there is an explicit ban on pants with words written on the butt (I am not sure why someone thought it was a good idea for people to stare at the butt of a seven-year-old). My family knows about my hatred of Barbie (although she still sometimes sneaks in during Christmas). I often pull my older daughter, Maya, aside and say, &#x201c;Just because Grandma thinks boys are stronger than girls doesn&#x2019;t mean it is true.&#x201d;<br> When Maya got the latest Barbie doll for her birthday, I remembered the experiment that found that girls who were given a Barbie to play with had a more negative view of their body and weight than girls who were given a more realistic doll. When she got the latest Disney princess movie, I mentally replayed the documentary <i>Mickey Mouse Monopoly</i>. In it, a ten-year-old girl innocently states, in response to what she learned by watching <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>, that she should just be nice to her boyfriend, even when he is mean to her (statistics about teen dating violence flashed through my head). So several birthday presents get &#x201c;lost&#x201d; in the trashcan between the party and the house.<br> Part of my problem is that I don&#x2019;t want to be the weird mom or daughter-in-law, nor do I want my daughters to be &#x201c;the weird kids.&#x201d; I don&#x2019;t want to put &#x201c;No Barbies&#x201d; on their birthday party invitations. I know some people will give Maya Barbies, but I also know that Maya will get other toys she&#x2019;ll enjoy too, and that she&#x2019;s never once missed or asked about a disappearing Barbie. All of this has me walking the fine line between stereotypes and social acceptance.<br><br> I also struggle because the biggest proponents of gender stereotypes, the biggest consumers of gender-typed toys, media, and clothes, are the caring, sweet women who love my children dearly. I have been blessed with parents and in-laws who are wonderful people. They are a challenge because they are kind people who mean no harm. One mother-in-law now just attaches the receipt with every gift in case I want to return it. So I try to edit out gender stereotypes without offending people. I can handle being thought of as weird, but I never want to be thought of as rude.<br> To back up a bit, I didn&#x2019;t start out this way. When I first got married, I didn&#x2019;t pay much attention to gender. I was young and childless and a recent college graduate. I was working with at-risk children in inner city schools and trying to figure out what I wanted to study in graduate school. And then my life changed on a Saturday afternoon at McDonald&#x2019;s.<br> I was in the drive-thru ordering a Happy Meal when the speaker blasted, &#x201c;A boy or a girl?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Huh?&#x201d; I said (I&#x2019;d been expecting a question about ketchup or napkins).<br><br> She repeated her question, clearly irritated that I wasn&#x2019;t going along with the script. &#x201c;Why does it matter?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;So we know what toy to put in it,&#x201d; she said. At that moment, I was struck by what a pointless question this was.&nbsp;<br><br> I drove home with my mental wheels turning: &#x201c;How does knowing if it&#x2019;s a boy or girl tell you what toy a kid will like?&#x201d; &#x201c;Why can&#x2019;t you just ask &#x2018;Do you want the My Little Pony or Legos?&#x2019;&#x201d; &#x201c;How often do we base our decisions on someone&#x2019;s gender?&#x201d; And most importantly, &#x201c;Does this affect who children turn out to be?&#x201d;<br><br> So, for the price of a Happy Meal, I now had a career goal. I needed to answer those questions. I went to graduate school, earned a PhD in developmental psychology, and specialized in how our obsession with gender and the differences between boys and girls affects children and their development. My eyes were opened to the many ways our society focuses on gender, even when it is irrelevant. I learned about how children socialize themselves to fit in with their same-gender group. I studied and conducted research on the damage gender stereotypes exact on boys and girls.<br><br> When I became a mom, my studies took on a whole new level of importance&#x2014;and complexity.&nbsp;When my first child, Maya, was very young, it was easy to focus on my goal of having a stereotype-free home. Lots of time and energy went into editing out the gender stereotypes around us. I would substitute the word &#x201c;kid&#x201d; in books when the author wrote &#x201c;boys&#x201d; or &#x201c;girls,&#x201d; I would tear out &#x201c;Peter Peter Pumpkin Eater, had a wife and couldn&#x2019;t keep her&#x201d; from the Mother Goose books, and I would only buy blue and green clothes to balance out all the pink clothes given to us.<br> My parenting style has relaxed a bit now, mainly because I also wanted to avoid making Maya the freaky social outcast who had never heard of Disney movies. My desire to raise a child without gender stereotypes was balanced by my desire to raise a child with friends and good social skills. Also, these struggles became more complex as Maya&#x2019;s very stereotypically girly friends started to have a powerful influence. I remember the painful day she marched home and proudly announced that her favorite color was no longer green but pink. This change was driven more by her desire to be like her best friend, Dakota, than anything else.&nbsp;<br><br> With my second daughter, Grace, my commitment to gender-blind parenting took on a different flavor, mainly because Grace was so different from Maya, and the unique characteristics I wanted to foster were different. I am reminded daily of how much variability there is between children, even when both are girls. Despite their similarities, they are different at their core. But I also suffer the same kind of fatigue everyone feels with a second child. I have less energy now to edit out every stereotype I find in a book or toy. I pick and choose my battles more often.<br><br> This book bridges what I know as a developmental psychologist with what I face trying to raise children in our society. It is a look at our cultural obsession with gender. I describe the science behind why we form stereotypes, how to know when those stereotypes are accurate and when they are misguided, and how those stereotypes affect boys and girls. I also describe the difficulties&#x2014;and rewards&#x2014;of parenting against the norm and why I think it is ultimately worth the fight.<br><br> The book is organized in three parts. Part I describes how we use gender constantly to sort, categorize, and label children and how that affects our thinking about people, including our own kids. Part II describes how that gender focus is, more often than not, inaccurate, and how most of our presumed gender differences are really more stereotype than science. Part III describes how our focus on gender differences can actually affect our own kids in the real world, how it can limit their strengths and abilities, and how you can realistically parent with a little less focus on gender and a little more focus on your individual children (without making your mother-in-law think you are a total nut job). With this approach, children can be more secure, happier, more well-rounded, and better able to reach their full potential (and it can be a lot more fun for parents).&nbsp;<br><br> My goal in this book isn&#x2019;t to convert everyone to my exact way of parenting. My goal is to help parents know what science really tells us about gender differences; to think about the ways parents understand and explain their children&#x2019;s behavior; to spend a few extra seconds before making a decision about what activities to enroll their children in; to think twice about believing that any difference between their son and daughter is entirely due to gender; to not always say, &#x201c;You know how boys are.&#x201d; Basically, I hope this book can help parents recognize and foster their children&#x2019;s unique strengths, even in a culture obsessed with fitting everyone into a pink or blue box.</p><h2>A History of the Ancient Near East: ca. 3000-323 BC (Blackwell History of the Ancient World)</h2><p>This book presents a clear, concise history of the extraordinarily multicultural civilizations of the Ancient Near East.

The bonobo, least known of the great apes, is a female-centered, egalitarian species that has been dubbed the "make-love-not-war" primate by specialists. In bonobo society, females form alliances to intimidate males, sexual behavior (in virtually every partner combination) replaces aggression and serves many social functions, and unrelated groups mingle instead of fighting. The species's most striking achievement is not tool use or warfare but sensitivity to others.<br><br>In the first book to combine and compare data from captivity and the field, Frans de Waal, a world-renowned primatologist, and Frans Lanting, an internationally acclaimed wildlife photographer, present the most up-to-date perspective available on the bonobo. Focusing on social organization, de Waal compares the bonobo with its better-known relative, the chimpanzee. The bonobo's relatively nonviolent behavior and the tendency for females to dominate males confront the evolutionary models derived from observing the chimpanzee's male power politics, cooperative hunting, and intergroup warfare. Further, the bonobo's frequent, imaginative sexual contacts, along with its low reproduction rate, belie any notion that the sole natural purpose of sex is procreation. Humans share over 98 percent of their genetic material with the bonobo and the chimpanzee. Is it possible that the peaceable bonobo has retained traits of our common ancestor that we find hard to recognize in ourselves?<br><br>Eight superb full-color photo essays offer a rare view of the bonobo in its native habitat in the rain forests of Zaire as well as in zoos and research facilities. Additional photographs and highlighted interviews with leading bonobo experts complement the text. This book points the way to viable alternatives to male-based models of human evolution and will add considerably to debates on the origin of our species. Anyone interested in primates, gender issues, evolutionary psychology, and exceptional wildlife photography will find a fascinating companion in <i>Bonobo: The Forgotten Ape</i>.</p><p>For Frans de Waal, man is not the only moral entity, as he made clear in his last book--<i>Good Natured: The Origins of Right and Wrong in Humans and Other Animals.</i> The author has long been intrigued by chimpanzee politics and mores, and now he has turned his human heart and scientific mind to a species science has tended to celebrate solely for its sex drive. Bonobos may look like chimps, but they are actually even closer to us--far more upright, physically, for a start. Furthermore, where chimpanzees hunt, fight, and politic like mad, bonobos are peaceful, often ambisexual, and matriarchal. (Of course, hyenas are matriarchal too, but that's another story ...) De Waal's collaborator, Frans Lanting, has been photographing these gentle creatures for some years and augments the primatologist's explorations and interviews with hundreds of superb color shots. The penultimate picture is of bonobos crossing a road while schoolchildren stand watching, a short distance away. If, as the truism goes, all books about animal behavior are ultimately about us, this exploration of the bonobo may be a step in the right direction."Here at last is a book that will give the fourth great ape the visibility that this wonderful species deserves. You will learn that bonobos are not just 'little' chimpanzees, but are every bit as different from chimpanzees as chimpanzees are from gorillas. If you care about the great apes, this book, with its superb photographs and vivid text, is a must."&#x2015;Jane Goodall<br><br>"Bonobo provides a tantalizing introduction into the natural history of one of our closest living relatives and uniquely enhances our understanding of our own place in Nature. Anyone who has the pleasure of reading this book will come away with deeper insights into why we humans behave the way we do. We should not be afraid of acknowledging the Bonobo in all of us."&#x2015;Don Johanson, Director, Institute of Human Origins<br><br>"With this book, de Waal and Lanting ask us to give bonobos their due&#x2015;to be considered along side the better known common chimpanzee as close human cousins. How nice to have the peaceable, sexy, bonobo added to the path of human evolution! Bonobos represent the silver lining in our ape heritage."&#x2015;Meredith Small, author of <i>What's Love Got to Do With It? The Evolution of Human Mating</i><br><br>"As a chronicler of natural history today, Frans Lanting is a singular, extraordinary talent. He has the mind of a scientist, the heart of a hunter, and the eyes of a poet. He is as persistent, adaptable, and hard as the wild creatures he observes. His bonobo photographs bring us face-to-face with a group of highly endangered apes. Eerily, aspects of their behavior mirror our own."&#x2015;Thomas R.

Known as the icon of ecology, Daphne will spend three months as the author in residence for the Inversgail schools. Janet Marsh and her business partners at Yon Bonnie Books are looking forward to hosting a gala book signing for her. Daphne, who hasn&#x2019;t set foot in Scotland in thirty years, is . . . eccentric. She lives in the Canadian wilderness, in a cabin she built herself, with only her dog for a companion, and her people skills have developed a few rough-hewn edges. She and the dog (which she insists on bringing with her) cause problems for the school, the library, and the bookshop even before they get to Inversgail. Then, on the misty night they arrive, a young man&#x2015;an American who&#x2019;d spent a night in the B&amp;B above Yon Bonnie Books&#x2015;is found dead outside a pub.<br><br> Daphne did her Inversgail homework and knows that Janet and her partners solved a previous murder. She tries to persuade them to join her in uncovering the killer and the truth. To prove she&#x2019;s capable, she starts poking and prying. But investigating crimes can be murder, and Daphne ends up dead, poisoned by scones from the tearoom at Yon Bonnie Books. Now, to save the reputation of their business&#x2015;not to mention the reputation of their scones&#x2015;Janet and her partners must solve both murders. And Daphne&#x2019;s dog might be able to help them, if only they can get it to stop howling. . .</p><p>Molly MacRae is the national bestselling author of the Haunted Yarn Shop Mystery Series, including Crewel and Unusual, and the Highland Bookshop Mystery Series, including Plaid and Plagiarism&nbsp;and&nbsp;Scones and Scoundrels.

But these clashes are dramatized through personal struggles. John Barton has to reconcile his personal conscience with his socialist duty, risking his life and liberty in the process. His daughter Mary is caught between two lovers, from opposing classes - worker and manufacturer. And at the heart of the narrative lies a murder which implicates them all. Mary Barton was published in 1848, at a time of great social ferment in Europe, and it reflects its revolutionary moment through an English lens. Elizabeth Gaskell wrote her first novel about the world in which she lived - Manchester at the height of the industrial revolution. As the wife of a Unitarian minister she was solidly middle-class; but she also had close contact with the working classes around her, sympathised with them, and represented their extreme distresses in her fiction. She is radical in taking on their dialect, imagining the realities of their lives, and placing a working woman at the centre of her fiction. If to our eyes her vision remains limited, it was an honest vision, for which she was much criticised in her own time, by her own class.</p><p>Elizabeth Gaskell (1810-65) moved from the London of her childhood to Knutsford and later Manchester, and her experience of the differences between North and South deeply informed her writing. Writer of six novels, numerous shorter works and the biography of her great friend Charlotte Bront�, Gaskell was at first published anonymously but later in her own name. Much of her work was serialised in Charles Dickens&#39;s widely-read literary weekly, Household Words. Mary Barton was Gaskell&#39;s first novel, and deals with many of the great social and political themes that came to be so distinctive of her work. Gaskell&#39;s other novels Cranford, North and South and Wives and Daughters are also published in the Penguin English Library.</p><h2>Nicole de V�sian: Gardens: Modern Design in Provence</h2><p><p><strong>De V�sian created gardens by studying the region, its plants, its light and its agricultural traditions</strong></p><p>After a career as a designer working for such great design houses as Herm�s, Nicole de V�sian (1916&#x2013;96) moved to Provence and created her first garden. On the narrow terraces around her home, de V�sian designed her own masterpiece in a minimal but far from austere style, composed mainly of heathland plants (varieties of thyme, lavender, rosemary, rockrose and box tree), in which she pruned all her plants to cushion shapes of varying yet superbly proportioned sizes, resulting in a breathtaking scene. Her gardens soon inspired gardeners and landscapers around the world. Today, few gardens have been imitated as readily as those of de V�sian. Her most notable garden is La Louve, which is her garden in Bonnieux, a French hilltop village in the Luberon area of Provence.<br><br><i>Nicole de V�sian: Gardens</i> is an up-to-date edition of de V�sian&#x2019;s bestselling 2011 monograph, with a new postface describing de V�sian's influence on the art of gardening. In general, the publication acts as a tribute to de V�sian and her life. Her close friend, acclaimed garden historian Louisa Jones (<i>The Garden Visitor&#x2019;s Companion</i>), shares her own thoughts on the work of this atypical creator, accompanied by accounts from her friends and pupils: Christian Lacroix, the nursery owner Jean-Marie Rey, the landscape artists Arnaud Mauri�res, �ric Ossart and Marc Nucera, as well as the garden historians Roy Strong and John Brookes. As Louisa Jones writes, de V�sian "has a feeling for space like musicians have a feeling for music."</p></p><p></p><h2>Saunders 2018-2019 Strategies for Test Success: Passing Nursing School and the NCLEX Exam (Saunders Strategies for Success for the Nclex Examination)</h2><p><p>Get more than just practice questions; get comprehensive test and nursing school preparation that's proven to help you succeed!

It deals with the central problems of the human condition--with important questions of free will, morality, life after death, the limits of logic and reason--though often in rather esoteric terms. Now, in <em>The Oxford Companion to Philosophy</em>, readers have the most authoritative and engaging one-volume reference work on philosophy available, offering clear and reliable guidance to the ideas of all notable philosophers from antiquity to the present day, and to the major philosophical systems around the globe, from Confucianism to phenomenology.<br> Here is indeed a world of thought, with entries on idealism and empiricism, ethics and aesthetics, epicureanism and stoicism, deism and pantheism, liberalism and conservativism, logical positivism and existentialism--over two thousand entries in all. The contributors represent a veritable who's who of modern philosophy, including such eminent figures as Isaiah Berlin, Sissela Bok, Ronald Dworkin, John Searle, Michael Walzer, and W. V. Quine. We read Paul Feyerabend on the history of the philosophy of science, Peter Singer on Hegel, Anthony Kenny on Frege, and Anthony Quinton on philosophy itself. We meet the great thinkers--from Aristotle and Plato, to Augustine and Aquinas, to Descartes and Kant, to Nietzsche and Schopenhauer, right up to contemporary thinkers such as Richard Rorty, Jacques Derrida, Luce Iragaray, and Noam Chomsky (over 150 living philosophers are profiled). There are short entries on key concepts such as personal identity and the mind-body problem, major doctrines from utilitarianism to Marxism, schools of thought such as the Heidelberg School or the Vienna Circle, and contentious public issues such as abortion, capital punishment, and welfare. In addition, the book offers short explanations of philosophical terms (qualia, supervenience, iff), puzzles (the Achilles paradox, the prisoner's dilemma), and curiosities (the philosopher's stone, slime). Almost every entry is accompanied by suggestions for further reading, and the book includes both a chronological chart of the history of philosophy and a gallery of portraits of eighty eminent philosophers, from Pythagoras and Confucius to Rudolf Carnap and G.E. Moore. And finally, as in all Oxford Companions, the contributors also explore lighter or more curious aspects of the subject, such as "Deaths of Philosophers" (quite a few were executed, including Socrates, Boethius, Giordano Bruno, and Thomas More) or "Nothing so Absurd" (referring to Cicero's remark that "There is nothing so absurd but some philosopher has said it"). Thus the <em>Companion</em> is both informative and a pleasure to browse in, providing quick answers to any question, and much intriguing reading for a Sunday afternoon.<br> An indispensable guide and a constant source of stimulation and enlightenment, <em>The Oxford Companion to Philosophy</em> with appeal to everyone interested in abstract thought, the eternal questions, and the foundations of human understanding.</p><p><br><strong>Ted Honderich</strong> is Grote Professor of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic at University College London, and has also taught at Yale and CUNY. He is the author of <em>A Theory of Determinism: The Mind, Neuroscience, and Life-Hopes</em> and <em>How Free Are You?</em><br>Editor Honderich sees this book not only as a reference work, but as "something more amiable than that. It diverts. It suits a Sunday morning." <i>The Oxford Companion to Philosophy</i> is an authoritative, alphabetically arranged encyclopedia. Honderich has assembled a distinguished roster of 240 contributors, including Isaiah Berlin, Anthony Kenny, Michael Dummett, Alasdair MacIntyre, W. V. Quine, and John Searle. Contributors and affiliations are listed in the front matter. The 1,931 signed entries are directed toward general readers fascinated with philosophy as well as philosophy students and professional philosophers.<p>Among the lengthiest entries (2,000 words or more) are those on the great philosophers of the past (Aristotle, Descartes, Kant, etc.), on the dozen or so major branches of philosophy (epistemology, metaphysics, logic), and on the most prominent "national" philosophies (American, Indian, Japanese). Shorter biographies focus on others prominent in the field, including some 150 contemporary philosophers. Rounding out the book are hundreds of articles on philosophical terms and dozens on national philosophies of lesser impact on the Anglo-American tradition (Croatian, Spanish, Swedish). Short bibliographies follow most entries. Three appendixes cover logical symbols used in this book, "maps" or family trees of various branches of philosophy, and a chronological table of philosophy. The index directs readers to related entries. Portraits of several dozen major philosophers are grouped by period or culture (medieval, French, Eastern).</p><p>The diversity of contributors has resulted in a wide variety of interesting, idiosyncratic articles. The one on the late Paul Feyerabend, for instance, begins "Austrian-American philosopher of science who argues for the abolition of his subject." Feyerabend, author of the article on the history of the philosophy of science, was thus a far-from-unbiased viewer of his own discipline. It might be argued that the various biases in <i>The Oxford Companion</i> somehow balance out in a way that a single-author work like Simon Blackburn's<i> Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy</i> [<i>RBB</i> Ja 15 95) cannot. Blackburn has more (2,500) but generally much shorter entries. A more apt comparison might be the venerable multivolume <i>Encyclopedia of Philosophy</i> (Macmillan, 1967), edited by Paul Edwards (a contributor to the present work). It boasts much longer articles but is necessarily silent on the last quarter-century of philosophy. <i>The Oxford Companion to Philosophy</i> is highly recommended for academic, public, and high-school libraries. <i></i></p></p><h2>The Journey to the West, Revised Edition, Volume 1 (Volume 1)</h2><p><p>Anthony C. Yu&#x2019;s translation of <i>The Journey to the West</i>,initially published in 1983, introduced English-speaking audiences to the classic Chinese novel in its entirety for the first time. Written in the sixteenth century, <i>The Journey to the West</i> tells the story of the fourteen-year pilgrimage of the monk Xuanzang, one of China&#x2019;s most famous religious heroes, and his three supernatural disciples, in search of Buddhist scriptures. Throughout his journey, Xuanzang fights demons who wish to eat him, communes with spirits, and traverses a land riddled with a multitude of obstacles, both real and fantastical. An adventure rich with danger and excitement, this seminal work of the Chinese literary canonis by turns allegory, satire, and fantasy.</p> <p><br> With over a hundred chapters written in both prose and poetry, <i>The Journey to the West</i> has always been a complicated and difficult text to render in English while preserving the lyricism of its language and the content of its plot. But Yu has successfully taken on the task, and in this new edition he has made his translations even more accurate and accessible. The explanatory notes are updated and augmented, and Yu has added new material to his introduction, based on his original research as well as on the newest literary criticism and scholarship on Chinese religious traditions. He has also modernized the transliterations included in each volume, using the now-standard Hanyu Pinyin romanization system. Perhaps most important, Yu has made changes to the translation itself in order to make it as precise as possible.<br> <br> One of the great works of Chinese literature, <i>The Journey to the West</i> is not only invaluable to scholars of Eastern religion and literature, but, in Yu&#x2019;s elegant rendering, also a delight for any reader.</p></p><p><p></p><b>Anthony C. Yu </b>is the Carl Darling Buck Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus at the University of Chicago.<p></p>&#x201c;In 1983, Anthony C. Yu&#x2019;s <i>The Journey to the West </i>conveyed intact to readers of English the classic that had enthralled Chinese children for centuries. It taught scholars that the novel&#x2019;s many poems were as important as its prose. This new version draws on thirty years of the author&#x2019;s further studies in literature and religion. It traces one theme after another to the Quanzhen Daoist movement and its new synthesis of religious thought. The translation is a joy to read, and the introduction and commentary reveal the deep foundations on which this fantastic tale of adventure is built.&#x201d;<br> (Nathan Sivin <i>University of Chicago</i>)</p><h2>Johns Hopkins Nursing Evidence Based Practice Model and Guidelines (Second Edition)</h2><p>The birth place of Internal Medicine, Johns Hopkins University continues to be a leader in the health care profession.

Dr. Romano has conducted research on &#x201c;bumpy moments&#x201d; (a term she coined to describe episodes during the practice of teaching that require additional reflection before acting) with both practicing and preservice teachers. This led to an interest in the successes and struggles of teachers, particularly during thefirst year of practice. Dr. Romano found that many of the &#x201c;bumpy moments&#x201d; and struggles of teaching identified,for both preservice and practicing teachers, were concerns about classroom management.

Effective vocabulary instruction is particularly vital in the content areas, where the specialized language used by &#x201c;insiders&#x201d; often creates a barrier to understanding for those new to the subjects. In Inside Words, Janet Allen merges recent research and key content-area teaching strategies to show teachers how to help students understand the academic vocabulary found in textbooks, tests, articles, and other informational texts. Each instructional tool is listed alphabetically along with its purpose: building background knowledge; teaching words that are critical to comprehension; providing support during reading and writing; developing a conceptual framework; and assessing students' understanding of words and concepts. Inside Words builds on Janet's previous books Words, Words, Words and Tools for Teaching Content Literacy, to provide a much-needed middle and secondary school resource for teaching vocabulary, not only in the language arts, but in all of the content areas.

This method&#x2013;along with foreshadowing&#x2013;is used throughout the text to provide students with a comfortable base for learning something new from something old or familiar. With just a few connections to algebra, students have the tools to understand the circular functions, their domains and ranges, and the relationship between the circular functions and the functional values. The approach immediately launches the student into the concept of periodic functions, their applications, graphs, and use in modeling many periodic phenomena. Beginning with this approach provides the student with a common thread that can be used to discover, connect and understand the remaining concepts of trigonometry.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></p><p></p><h2>A Critical History of German Film (Studies in German Literature Linguistics and Culture) (Volume 93)</h2><p>A history of German film dealing with individual films as works of art has long been needed. Existing histories tend to treat cinema as an economic rather than an aesthetic phenomenon; earlier surveys that do engage with individual films do not include films of recent decades. This book treats representative films from the beginnings of German film to the present. Providing historical context through an introduction and interchapters preceding the treatments of each era's films, the volume is suitable for semester- or year-long survey courses and for anyone with an interest in German cinema.BR&gt; The films: The Student of Prague - The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari - The Last Laugh - Metropolis - The Blue Angel - M - Triumph of the Will - The Great Love - The Murderers Are among Us - Sun Seekers - Trace of Stones - The Legend of Paul and Paula - Solo Sunny - The Bridge - Young T�rless - Aguirre, The Wrath of God - Germany in Autumn - The Marriage of Maria Braun - The Tin Drum - Marianne and Juliane - Wings of Desire - Maybe, Maybe Not - Rossini - Run Lola Run - Good Bye Lenin! - Head On - The Lives of Others Stephen Brockmann is Professor of German at Carnegie Mellon University and President of the German Studies Association.

However, most impressive of all, given the amount of material he covers, is its readability. The volume has a wonderfully accessible style that explains while never patronizing the reader. Its tone will no doubt ensure its successwith its intended audience, as well as any other reader who wishes to obtain a clear sense of German film&#39;s unique contribution to world cinema. JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN STUDIES (Paul Cooke) (O)ccupies a unique position in contemporary film scholarship. . . . (W)ritten with remarkable clarity in a refreshingly jargon-free idiom . . . . (A)n indispensable volume for both students and teachers of film. . . . (T)here is no comparable study that offers such a comprehensive and even-handed overview of the landmarks of German cinema in their socio-political context, and Brockmann&#39;s volume will surely become a core text on both undergraduate and graduate film courses for many years to come. MODERN LANGUAGE REVIEW (T)he first encompassing study (of German film) to construct its account largely through extended discussion of key film works. . . . (S)ubstantially successful in illustrating broad arguments about historical development through detailed attention to the narrative texture of canonical films. . . . (T)his is a volume that can certainly be recommended as a textbook for the study of German film. JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN STUDIES (Andrew Webber) Brockmann&#39;s approach is new and original. Students will find an excellent starting point in their understanding of German film history with this book. University libraries should offer (it) to their students, along with DVD copies of the classic movies discussed. GERMAN STUDIES REVIEW Currently the only available history of German cinema written in English that both charts German film history from its beginnings during the Kaiserreich to its state in the third millennium and provides a series of sustained readings of individual films. . . . Brockmann&#39;s critical intervention . . . is without doubt an achievement that will become canonical in courses surveying German film history.

BOMC &amp; History. UP.</p><p>In the Christian world there is no more powerful image than that of Jesus Christ. Yet with each generation that image is reinterpreted through the philosophy and art of the time. Pelikan, a noted Yale history scholar, theologian, and author, here revisits one of his earlier books, Jesus Through the Centuries (LJ 10/1/85). In this revision, Pelikan has abridged the text and turns to illustrations to convey his interpretations. The result is a lighter, easier text with a lovely accompaniment of art. Very beautiful and very appealing for the general reader, this edition by no means replaces the scholarship and documentation of the first; those notations and references are missing in the illustrated edition.

J. Muste, Dorothy Day, Howard Thurman, Thomas Merton, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Fannie Lou Hamer&#x2015;inspired individuals who succeeded in conveying their vision to the broader public through writing, speaking, demonstrating, and organizing. Raboteau traces how their paths crossed and their lives intertwined, creating a network of committed activists who significantly changed the attitudes of several generations of Americans about contentious political issues such as war, racism, and poverty. Raboteau examines the influences that shaped their ideas and the surprising connections that linked them together. He discusses their theological and ethical positions, and describes the rhetorical and strategic methods these exemplars of modern prophecy used to persuade their fellow citizens to share their commitment to social change.</p><p>A momentous scholarly achievement as well as a moving testimony to the human spirit, <i>American Prophets</i> represents a major contribution to the history of religion in American politics.

But it's true: this is indeed one of the most important and influential books ever written, and it is one of the very few groundbreaking works of science that is truly readable.<p> To a certain extent it suffers from the Hamlet problem--it's full of clich�s! Or what are now clich�s, but which Darwin was the first to pen. Natural selection, variation, the struggle for existence, survival of the fittest: it's all in here.</p><p> Darwin's friend and "bulldog" T.H. Huxley said upon reading the <i>Origin</i>, "How extremely stupid of me not to have thought of that." Alfred Russel Wallace had thought of the same theory of evolution Darwin did, but it was Darwin who gathered the mass of supporting evidence--on domestic animals and plants, on variability, on sexual selection, on dispersal--that swept most scientists before it. It's hardly necessary to mention that the book is still controversial: Darwin's remark in his conclusion that "Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history" is surely the pinnacle of British understatement. <i>--Mary Ellen Curtin</i></p>Jim Endersby&#39;s major new scholarly edition debunks some of the myths that surround Darwin&#39;s book, and expores how it was originally written, published and read. Endersby provides a new, up-to-date and very readable introduction to this classic text and a level of scholarly apparatus unmatched by any other edition.</p><h2>How to Preach and Teach the Old Testament for All Its Worth</h2><p><p>Many preachers ignore preaching from the Old Testament because they feel it is outdated in light of the New Testament and difficult to expound. On the other hand, some preachers will preach from the Old Testament frequently but fail to handle it correctly, turning it into moralistic rules or symbolic lessons for our spiritual life. In <em>How to Preach and Teach the Old Testament for All Its Worth</em>, Christopher J. H. Wright proclaims that preachers must not ignore the Old Testament. It is the Word of God!

In fact, for most of my life, I've been running away from the real me and, instead, chasing this image of who I wanted to be. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>I wanted to be this amazing wife and mother, a smart businesswoman, a world-changing Jesus follower. I wanted my life to matter, to make a difference.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Problem is, most days I feel about as far away from those things as the sea is from the sky. No matter how hard I try, I just can't seem to get it right.&nbsp;I wake up early, I stay up late, but the to-dos are never done. I start the day determined to love my husband and children better, but then I want to wring their necks usually before dinner. I read my Bible and pray, but I keep blowing it, making mistakes, and acting anything but Jesus-like.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The short of it is this: As much as I put on a confident front, most days I struggle to like who I am.&nbsp;<br><br>For me, this struggle got more personal when a cancer diagnosis and resulting surgery and treatment radically altered my body, my relationships, and my abilities.

He runs his family life as he runs his firm: coldly, calculatingly and commercially. The only person he cares for is his little son, while his motherless daughter Florence craves affection from her unloving father, who sees her only as a base coin that couldn&#39;t be invested&#39;. As Dombey&#39;s callousness extends to others - from his defiant second wife Edith to Florence&#39;s admirer Walter Gay - he sows the seeds for his own destruction. Can this heartless businessman be redeemed? A compelling depiction of a man imprisoned by his own pride, &#34;Dombey and Son&#34; (1848) explores the devastating effects of emotional deprivation on a dysfunctional family and on society as a whole.</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.&#34;Dombey and Son, Charles Dickens&#39;s story of a powerful man whose callous neglect of his family triggers his professional and personal downfall, showcases the author&#39;s gift for vivid characterization and unfailingly realistic description. As Jonathan Lethem contends in his Introduction, Dickens&#39;s &#34;genius . . . is at one with the genius of the form of the novel itself: Dickens willed into existence the most capacious and elastic and versatile kind of novel that could be, one big enough for his vast sentimental yearnings and for every impulse and fear and hesitation in him that countervailed those yearnings too. Never parsimonious and frequently contradictory, he always gives us everything he can, everything he&#39;s planned to give, and then more.&#34; This Modern Library Paperback Classic was set from the 1867 &#34;Charles Dickens&#34; edition.</p><h2>Workbook to Accompany The Complete Musician: Workbook 2: Skills and Musicianship</h2><p>Reorganized for greater flexibility, the two workbooks that accompany <em>The Complete Musician</em>, Third Edition, feature an innovative structure and format.

Virginia Thompson founded the FAMILY MATH program at The Lawrence Hall of Science.I'd learned about Lawrence Hall of Science's FAMILY MATH books. I jumped at the opportunity to review The Middle School Years version. My 10-year-old son has decreed it to be a cool looking book, with fun illustrations throughout. For our first activity, we chose "Ten, Twenty, Thirty," a mental math game using playing cards. As far as my son is concerned, anything that uses playing cards simply cannot be math! I could see the wheels grinding and had the pants beat off me each time we played. If you tire of one version, the authors list variations. <p>The book is filled with quick, punchy, eye-catching one- and two-page activities. Extensions help expand the activity and spark creativity. Some of the concepts include variables, graphing, price comparison, fractions, and adding decimals. -- <i>Reviewed by Cathy Koos Breazeal.

Jung</h2><p><p>In exploring the manifestations of human spiritual experience both in the imaginative activities of the individual and in the formation of mythologies and of religious symbolism in various cultures, C. G. Jung laid the groundwork for a psychology of the spirit.

This compact volume will serve as an ideal introduction to Jung's basic concepts.</p><br><p> Part I of this book, "On the Nature and Functioning of the Psyche," contains material from four works: "Symbols of Transformation," "On the Nature of the Psyche," "The Relations between the Ego and the Unconscious," and "Psychological Types."

Part II, "On Pathology and Therapy," includes "On the Nature of Dreams," "On the Pathogenesis of Schizophrenia," and selections from "Psychology of the Transference." In Part III appear "Introduction to the Religious and Psychological Problems of Alchemy" and two sections of "Psychology and Religion."

Flighty Lydia wants a man--any man--preferably one in uniform. Kitty just wants to have fun. Shy Mary has her nose in a book. And Elizabeth--brilliant, stubborn, independent Lizzy--refuses the advances of the most "marriageable" man in town--haughty, handsome, <i>wealthy</i> Mr. Darcy.</p><p>Mrs. Bennet's in hysterics, Mr. Bennet's in his study, Lydia's eloped with a soldier and Jane's heart may well be broken. Will <i>any</i> of the Bennet girls find true love and fortune?</p></p><p><i>"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."</i><p> Next to the exhortation at the beginning of <i>Moby-Dick</i>, "Call me Ishmael," the first sentence of Jane Austen's <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> must be among the most quoted in literature. And certainly what Melville did for whaling Austen does for marriage--tracing the intricacies (not to mention the economics) of 19th-century British mating rituals with a sure hand and an unblinking eye. As usual, Austen trains her sights on a country village and a few families--in this case, the Bennets, the Philips, and the Lucases. Into their midst comes Mr. Bingley, a single man of good fortune, and his friend, Mr. Darcy, who is even richer. Mrs. Bennet, who married above her station, sees their arrival as an opportunity to marry off at least one of her five daughters. Bingley is complaisant and easily charmed by the eldest Bennet girl, Jane; Darcy, however, is harder to please. Put off by Mrs. Bennet's vulgarity and the untoward behavior of the three younger daughters, he is unable to see the true worth of the older girls, Jane and Elizabeth. His excessive pride offends Lizzy, who is more than willing to believe the worst that other people have to say of him; when George Wickham, a soldier stationed in the village, does indeed have a discreditable tale to tell, his words fall on fertile ground. </p><p> Having set up the central misunderstanding of the novel, Austen then brings in her cast of fascinating secondary characters: Mr. Collins, the sycophantic clergyman who aspires to Lizzy's hand but settles for her best friend, Charlotte, instead; Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Mr. Darcy's insufferably snobbish aunt; and the Gardiners, Jane and Elizabeth's low-born but noble-hearted aunt and uncle. Some of Austen's best comedy comes from mixing and matching these representatives of different classes and economic strata, demonstrating the hypocrisy at the heart of so many social interactions. And though the novel is rife with romantic misunderstandings, rejected proposals, disastrous elopements, and a requisite happy ending for those who deserve one, Austen never gets so carried away with the romance that she loses sight of the hard economic realities of 19th-century matrimonial maneuvering. Good marriages for penniless girls such as the Bennets are hard to come by, and even Lizzy, who comes to sincerely value Mr. Darcy, remarks when asked when she first began to love him: "It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley." She may be joking, but there's more than a little truth to her sentiment, as well. Jane Austen considered Elizabeth Bennet "as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print". Readers of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> would be hard-pressed to disagree. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

Clay, one of the most important players in Congress, offers a candid, up-to-date history of black elected officials in the U.S. Congress.<br>As the senior member of the Missouri Congressional delegation and a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, William L. Clay shares thirty-four years of experiences and insight into the political process and the roles that black elected officials have played in the process, from the post-Civil War era up to now. From the election of Senator Hiram R. Revels in 1870 to the election of Congresswoman Maxine Waters in 1991, Congressman Clay dispels the myths and misinformation about black politicians. He recounts their struggles, victories and losses, and sets the record straight about the enormous contributions they have made, which benefit not only other blacks, but Americans of all ethnicities.<br>Congressman Clay shows how "the business of effective government is neither fun nor games for elected officials. It is not easy work, short hours, and unending cocktail parties. It is a rough, tough business" and given pervasive unemployment, excessive numbers of women heading households without support, high rates of crime and teen-age pregnancies, and all the other tragic conditions that are part of the black community, citizens - activists and aspiring politicians alike - need to know how the system really works and can work to empower as well as suppress black people. Just Permanent Interests delivers a wealth of information on and analysis of American politics useful to students, professionals, and voters in general.<br>Congressman Clay documents black involvement in politics during the Reconstruction era, then brings the reader through the turmoil of the Civil Rights Movement. He reveals the racial dynamics of congressional politics and the events that led to the founding of the Congressional Black Caucus. He describes the relationship of the Caucus to Democratic and Republican administrations of the last two decades as well as the relationships between members of the Caucus - "the single most effective political entity we [black Americans] have had." He exposes the beauty marks and warts of the Black Caucus and provides a timely examination of how the current political policies of both the Democratic and Republican parties affect African-Americans.<br>The only chronicle of its kind-written by a political insider - Congressman Clay's account gives clarity and meaning to the official motto of the Congressional Black Caucus: Black people have/ No permanent friends,/ No permanent enemies,/ Just permanent interests.</p><p>Clay, a 12-term member of the House of Representatives, has written a partly historical, partly sociological, partly political study of the role of African Americans in Congress. From Reconstruction to the dramatic increase in their numbers in the 1980s, he traces the lives and political travails of black members of Congress. While professional historians and political scientists may find his book lacking in analytical rigor, it provides some valuable insights and interesting anecdotes. It is especially revealing of the development of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) and its subsequent planning and tactics. Clay's treatment of the early years (1870-1940) tends to be sketchy; however, he more than compensates for this in the contemporary period. Also, his treatment of these congressmen is not completely objective, as his views of Adam Clayton Powell and Robert N.C. Nix demonstrate. Overall, this is an important book, one that makes readers realize the importance of traditional grassroots electoral politics to improve the political power of African Americans as opposed to the rhetoric and symbolism of street protests.<br><i>- Thomas Baldiono, Wilkes Univ., Wilkes-Barre, Pa.</i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.Part catalogue, part history, this study of African Americans in Congress offers some useful information but suffers from an erratic focus and a lack of candor. Clay, a veteran member of the House of Representatives from St. Louis, aims to compensate for histories of Congress that slight black achievements. While he brings to life such important figures as Hiram Rhoades Revels, the first black senator (in 1870), and explains the growth of the Congressional Black Caucus, Clay spends far too long on biographical sketches of black politicians and verbatim excerpts from hortatory speeches. Moreover, while he argues plausibly that black politicians have been unfairly targeted by investigators, Clay devotes eight pages to defending himself against ethics charges, while ignoring political criti cism and ignores some real scandals, such as the one involving Congressman Gus Savage of Chicago. Further, Clay's stated belief that whites hate blacks leaves no room for discussion of current debates on racial issues. Photos not seen by PW.

When the mother of one of them begins an affair with a ship&#39;s officer, he and his friends idealise the man at first; but it is not long before they conclude that he is in fact soft and romantic.

He wrote countless stories and thirty-three plays, in some of which he performed. Several films have been made from his novels, including The Sound of Waves, Enjo which was based on The Temple of the Golden Pavilion and The Sailor Who Fell From Grace with the Sea. Among his other works are the novels Confessions of a Mask and Thirst for Love and the short story collections Death in Midsummer and Acts of Worship. The Sea of Fertility tetralogy, however, is his masterpiece. After Mishima conceived the idea of The Sea of Fertility in 1964, he frequently said he would die when it was completed. On 25 November 1970, the day he completed The Decay of the Angel, the last novel of the cycle, Mishima committed seppuku (ritual suicide) at the age of forty-five.</p><h2>Psychiatry: A Very Short Introduction</h2><p>Psychiatry is increasingly a part of everyday life. The growing number of patients being diagnosed with depression, ADD, alcoholism, and other illnesses mean that few people are not touched by it. This book provides a valuable and comprehensible introduction to the subject. It starts with the history of its development as a scientific field, including the identification of major mental illnesses, the rise and fall of the asylum system, and the flourishing of psychoanalysis and other psychotherapies. More than any other branch of medicine, psychiatry has been attacked and criticized. There is a long list of perceived horrors--patient abuse, bizarre medical experiments, mind-control by evil governments, coercion by maniacal hypnotists. Modern psychiatry brings with it new controversies, such as the perceived over-prescription of antidepressants and behavior modifiers for children and teens, or unchecked marketing power of drug companies. This book does not draw conclusions on these issues, but rather provides the reader with a clear understanding of what psychiatry is, and what it does, so that they can draw their own. It is a great reference for anyone with an interest in mental illness and its treatment, students of psychiatry, medicine, psychology, and history of science, and health professionals.</p><p><br><strong>Tom Burns</strong> is Professor of Social Psychiatry at the University of Oxford and a practicing consultant psychiatrist in the National Health Service.<br><br>"An awful lot of information is packed into this short and very readable text written by the professor of Social Psychiatry at Oxford University...The absolute bonus of this book is its compact and neat size which means it can be tucked away in a jacket pocket and dipped into in an idle moment! If you are looking to refine or extend your understanding of the seemingly dark arts of psychiatry, then I can recommend this to you."--David Haldane, <em>Occupational Medicine</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Assessing Students with Special Needs (7th Edition)</h2><p>This comprehensive text for future teachers of learners with disabilities is grounded in the idea that assessment is at the center of all good teaching. Its hallmarks are its accessibility, balanced coverage of both this formal and informal assessment, plus thorough exploration of the link between <i>gathering</i> information and actually <i>using</i> it to make informed decisions. Offering a step-by-step <i>Assessment Question Model</i> on the inside front cover, it equips readers to understand the complete assessment process, from choosing the best tool, to adapting instruction to improving outcomes. Popular, as well as lesser-known, tools are examined in order to acquaint readers with promising procedures for assessing students with special needs.</p><p>PREFACE <p> Assessment is at the center of all good teaching, and this book is designed to provide a clear, comprehensive guide to the assessment of students with mild disabilities. This book will give you an understanding of the assessment process as well as the practical skills needed to assess students with special needs successfully so that you can teach them well. To structure the process, we offer an assessment question model and we have developed the idea of the Individualized Assessment Plan (IAP). Our basis for the assessment questions and suggested procedures is a combination of best professional practices and legal mandates. This functional approach allows you sufficient flexibility to explore the areas and types of assessment in which you are particularly interested. In accordance with our belief that educators need useful information, we maintain a strong educational orientation toward assessment. NEW TO THE FIFTH EDITION </p><p> This is the fifth edition of Assessing Students with Special Needs, and it reflects many changes in professional thought and practice in both special education and general education. Topics new to this edition include recent legislation (e.g., the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Amendments), reform movements in general and special education, techniques for ongoing classroom assessment (e.g., functional assessment of behavior), test accommodations for students with disabilities, assessment for grading and report cards, evaluation of new areas of interest such as phonological processing, and the development of collaborative parent-professional partnerships in the assessment process. </p><p> The fifth edition is organized somewhat differently from previous editions, although the content covered is the same. The entire book has been thoroughly updated with current literature and coverage of pertinent issues, trends, and professional practices. Throughout we maintain our interest in the promotion of nonbiased assessment of culturally and linguistically diverse students. Chapter 14, in particular, focuses on strategies for the assessment of students who speak dialects of English and those who speak languages other than English. </p><p> Part One of the fifth edition, Introduction to Special Education Assessment, includes information on the purposes of assessment, laws and regulations governing assessment, the team approach to assessment, the organization of the assessment process using the assessment question model, and the steps in assessment. Part Two, Assessment Skills for Special Educators, contains chapters on selecting the tools for assessment, administration and scoring of standardized tests, and design and use of informal assessment techniques and procedures. A new chapter has also been introduced&#x2013;Chapter 6, Classroom Assessment Techniques&#x2013;and it describes a range of techniques for evaluating student progress in the classroom instructional program. These techniques include functional behavioral assessment, curriculum-based measurement, action research, and portfolio assessment. This chapter also discusses important issues in ongoing assessment such as managing student data, grading and report cards, and test accommodations. </p><p> Part Three of the fifth edition, Assessment of General Performance Areas, centers around the general performance areas most relevant to eligibility assessment: school performance, learning aptitude, specific learning abilities and strategies, and classroom behavior. Part Four, Assessment of Academic Areas, focuses on the assessment of academic skills: reading, mathematics, written language, and oral language and bilingual assessment. Part Five, Special Considerations, provides information on three important topics: parent and family involvement in assessment, assessment during the preschool years, and assessment for transition planning. </p><p> This edition also features new tests and assessment procedures, many of which are revised versions of measures described in earlier editions. More than 80 new published measures are included. Among the new instruments we discuss are:</p><p>Peabody Individual Achievement Test-Revised/Normative Update Hammill Multiability Achievement Test Wide Range Achievement Test-Revision 3 BRIGANCE� Diagnostic Comprehensive Inventory of Basic Skills-Revised Bateria Woodcock-Mu�oz-Revisada Hammill Multiability Intelligence Test Test of Nonverbal Intelligence (3rd ed.)

The chief strength of this text remains its balanced coverage of formal and informal assessment. Critiques of the strengths and weaknesses of formal tests and informal procedures help you to select the tools that will supply the information you need. </p><p> We have chosen to speak about popular assessment procedures as well as less well known, but distinctive, measures. Popular instruments are discussed in some depth, not necessarily because they are always the best techniques, but because they reflect current practice. On the other hand, information about less well known tests and techniques is provided to acquaint you with promising procedures. With this comprehensive coverage, you will find out not only what is currently being done (and how well) but also what needs to be changed and how to do that. </p><p> In addition, we provide the connection between gathering assessment information and using it to make decisions. There are regular reminders to consider assessment data in relation to the classroom setting and suggestions for making sense out of all the information gathered. This process is described in the context of a team approach to educational assessment but with particular emphasis on the role of the special education teacher. </p><p> To make our book a more practical classroom resource, we have included several useful case reports, sample test profiles, checklists, and illustrations. Also, information boxes throughout the chapters summarize the important characteristics of tests discussed in depth. We have tried to give you a feel for the procedures you will use in assessment and to critique and relate them to one another so that you can better understand how to use them. Each chapter begins with a brief topical outline of its contents and ends with a Study Guide containing factual review questions, applied activities, and discussion questions focusing on critical issues addressed in the chapter. Companion Website </p><p> A companion website is available for both students and professors. Students can take self-quizzes and submit their responses online to the professor as well as view their scores and obtain page references in the text for answers to questions marked incorrect. Students also have access to chat rooms and bulletin boards for peer discussion. Instructors will have a Syllabus Builder&#x2122; which allows them to develop and customize a syllabus for their course. The address of the companion website for Assessing Students with Special Needs is: prenhall/mcloughlin. Support Materials for Instructors </p><p> The instructor support package for the fifth edition includes an Instructor's Manual, Computerized Test Banks in both Macintosh and Windows formats, and the companion website described above. </p><p> Instructor's Manual<br> The Instructor's Manual, organized by chapter, contains a chapter overview, a detailed outline, glossary terms, a set of questions appropriate for class discussions, and suggested activities. Also within the manual are objective test questions (multiple-choice, true-false, and completion) as well as a set of instructional aids that could be used in teaching an assessment course to prospective special educators. </p><p> Computerized Test Bank<br> In addition to the printed test bank of questions found in the Instructor's Manual, the Prentice Hall Custom Test is available in either Macintosh� or Windows� format. This software is available upon request from your Prentice Hall sales representative.

Not executed without controversy, the restoration renewed the vivid colors of Michelangelo's greatest work--in fact, caused a reevaluation in the minds of art historians of the master's use of color. (The controversy centered on concern that restorers had taken off <i>too much</i> of the accumulated overlay of the ages and that maybe Michelangelo had himself surfaced the frescoes with a layering of varnish <i>meant</i> to subdue the vibrant coloring.) Approximately 300 photographs of the restored frescoes are brilliantly presented here, a visual enticement to enjoy the original color as well as the form and the composition of these spectacular works. Accompanying the perfect reproductions are nine essays by specialists discussing such topics as Michelangelo's preparatory drawings for the figures in the frescoes, the plaster and pigment techniques he employed, the issue of whether he used assistants or not, and his use of color. This magnificent, celebratory book--of both the frescoes and their restoration--belongs in every active art-history collection. <i>Brad Hooper</i></p><h2>The Gods of the Egyptians, Volume 1</h2><p>Thoth, the ibis-headed god of wisdom, inventor of the art of writing; Osiris, the dead god who arose and set the pattern for death-and-resurrection gods ever since; Isis, the great mother, wandering through the reed swamps; Anubis, conductor of the dead, with jackal head; Bast, the cat goddess; Set, the evil serpent; Ptah, the living mummy ... For more than 2,500 years, since the days of Herodotus, students have found the gods of Ancient Egypt a source of fascination and wonder. Strange beings who lived in a world of their own (as opposed to the human gods of the European people), irrational powers and menaces, sometimes animal-like, sometimes superhuman, sometimes incalculable in their evil potentialities, they still have the power to move men's thought.<br>By far the most thorough, most useful coverage of the gods of Ancient Egypt is this book by Dr. Budge of the British Museum, one of the foremost Egyptologists of the century. In it is presented practically everything known about the high gods, the local gods, demigods, demons, and mythological figures of Khem. Dr. Budge provides full information on the origins of the ancient religion; its peculiarly Egyptian aspects; evolution of cults, rites, and gods; the priesthoods; the heretical aberration of Ikhnaten and the Aten cult; the cult of Osiris; the Book of the Dead and its rites; the sacred animals and birds; heaven and hell, and much other secret wisdom that has been discovered hidden in mummy cases or written on tomb walls. The text is profusely illustrated, with many reproductions of tomb and mummy-case paintings, while many full texts are presented, with both hieroglyphs and translation.<br>Dr. Budge's book is a standard work in the history of religion. It is also a most useful background book for anyone seriously interested in the life and thought of Ancient Egypt, an explicator of many of the obscurer passages in the Book of Dead.</p><p></p><h2>Poetry for Young People: Robert Louis Stevenson</h2><p>"A collection of 32 poems...A short introductory biography...gives an insightful glimpse into his life and how it influenced his poems....illustrations convey the poetic notion of a romantic childhood memory, with pink-cheeked children...Muted colors, rich with warm golden accents among the dominant green tone, are a peaceful accompaniment to the poems."--<i>School Library Journal</i>.

For more than 20 years, Lois Burdett has asked that question of her elementary school students in Stratford, Ontario, Canada, leading them on a voyage of discovery that brings the Bard to life for boys and girls ages seven and up. </p><p> <i>Twelfth Night for Kids</i>, written in rhyming couplets is suitable for staging as class plays as well as reading aloud. </p></p><p><p><b> Shakespeare Can Be Fun! </b></p><p> Most students will be exposed to the works of Shakespeare, typically in high school. The language and content of the plays is seen as too difficult for younger children but primary children are underestimated as to what they can accomplish given the challenge. The study of Shakespeare has become an integral part of my grade two program at Hamlet School, in Stratford, Ontario, Canada. </p><p> When I first moved to Stratford, I had no intention of teaching Shakespeare to 7 and 8 year olds. Stratford is a beautiful city noted for its Shakespearean theatre and I was interested that the schools were all named after Shakespearean characters. I asked my class, "Who is William Shakespeare?" and "Why is our school called Hamlet?" Their answers were surprising. One thought he was a famous boxer. Another believed he was the President of Canada. A third student responded, "I don't know who William Shakespeare is. I don't know any of the big kids." It was the children's enthusiasm and excitement on making the connection between an historical figure and the name of their school, which led me to continue. Thirty years later I can't imagine teaching anywhere in the world and not introducing Shakespeare. The study provided tremendous growth, particularly in the area of language and communication and evolved into a learning experience of a lifetime. I have endeavored in my books and workshops for teachers to share the excitement of exploring with children, the timeless emotions and ideas of Shakespeare. </p><p> The comments of two of my children, written at various times in their daily journals show the lasting impression Shakespeare has had on them. </p><p> "Shakespeare is like a big piece of chocolate cake. Once you've started you wish you could go on and on forever, in a non-stopping dream." (Anika, age 7) </p><p> "William's incredible words are like a velvet silk coat that rap around his pure thoughts. His pen writes on like all colors of the wind." (Sean, age 7) </p><p> <b>Lois Burdett</b>'s success in introducing Shakespeare to children is reflected in her growing international reputation. Her books and workshops for teachers have captured the attention and imagination of parents, educators, and lovers of Shakespeare around the world, including the American National Council of Teachers of English and the International Reading Association. Among other commendations, Lois Burdett has received <i>Encyclopedia Britannica's National Award for Early Childhood Education</i>, Canada's <i>Meritorious Service Medal</i>, the Canadian Teachers' Federation's <i>Hilroy Fellowship</i>, and two writers' awards. Burdett's many speaking engagements have included the International Reading Association and the National Council of Teachers of English. Her books, magazine articles, presentations and media interviews are testimony to her strong influence in the education community, where she has also been instrumental in helping teachers to incorporate Shakespeare into early grade curricula. </p><p> <b>Christine Coburn</b> is originally from the United Kingdom. She emigrated to Canada and eventually moved to Stratford, Ontario.

Full of eloquence, epic grandeur, and myth, his haunting, rhapsodic poems still cast their lyrical spell today.</p><p>Alfred, Lord Tennyson was born in 1809 at Somersby, Lincolnshire. Schooled at Louth and by his father, a rector, he began to write early, and at the age of twelve he composed &#x201c;an epic of 6,000 lines.&#x201d; In 1828 he matriculated at Cambridge&#x2014;but only after the elder Tennyson had approved his recitation by heart of the odes of Horace. <b>Poems, Chiefly Lyrical</b>, published in 1830, revealed Tennyson&#x2019;s swiftly maturing talent, a talent which was augmented by his friendship with Edward FitzGerald and A.H. Hallam. In 1830, the poet and Hallam volunteered in the army of a Spanish insurgent; and <b>Poems</b> (1833) derived largely from experience gained on the Continent. Hallam&#x2019;s death in the same year gave rise to <b>The Two Voices</b> (1834)&#x2014;a black period in Tennyson&#x2019;s life. After a lengthy silence he published <b>Poems</b> (1842), earning the admiration of Carlyle and Dickens. The year 1850 witnessed his marriage to Emily Sarah Sellwood and his appointment as poet laureate, succeeding Wordsworth. The gravity with which he took his office was reflected in many poems on state occasions. His later years produced his acknowledged masterpieces: <b>In Memoriam</b> (1850), <b>Maud</b> (1855), <b>Ballads and Other Poems</b> (1880), <b>Locksley Hall Sixty Years After</b> (1886), and scattered sections of what would eventually become his epic, <b>Idylls of the King</b> (1859-1885). In 1892, reading his favorite Shakespeare, Tennyson died at Aldworth and received a public funeral in Westminster Abbey.</p><h2>The Ukrainians: Unexpected Nation, Second edition</h2><p>This book is the most acute, informed, and insightful account of Ukraine and its people available today. Andrew Wilson focuses on the complex relations between Ukraine and Russia and explains the different versions of the past propagated by Ukrainians and Russians. He also examines the continuing debates over identity, culture, and religion in Ukraine since its independence in 1991. For this new edition, Wilson has brought the text fully up to date to include coverage of the Yushchenko government and the &#34;Gongadze affair.&#34;</p><p>As in many postcommunist states, politics in Ukraine revolves around the issue of national identity. Ukrainian nationalists see themselves as one of the world&#39;s oldest and most civilized peoples, as &#34;older brothers&#34; to the younger Russian culture. Yet Ukraine became independent only in 1991, and Ukrainians often feel like a minority in their own country, where Russian is still the main language heard on the streets of the capital, Kiev. This book is a comprehensive guide to modern Ukraine and to the versions of its past propagated by both Russians and Ukrainians. Andrew Wilson provides the most acute, informed, and up-to-date account available of the Ukrainians and their country.Concentrating on the complex relation between Ukraine and Russia, the book begins with the myth of common origin in the early medieval era, then looks closely at the Ukrainian experience under the tsars and Soviets, the experience of minorities in the country, and the path to independence in 1991. Wilson also considers the history of Ukraine since 1991 and the continuing disputes over identity, culture, and religion. He examines the economic collapse under the first president, Leonid Kravchuk, and the attempts at recovery under his successor, Leonid Kuchma. Wilson explores the conflicts in Ukrainian society between the country&#39;s Eurasian roots and its Western aspirations, as well as the significance of the presidential election of November 1999."In this excellent guide, Wilson charts the history of Ukrainian nationalism over the centuries and examines the ways in which Ukrainians have understood their culture, myths, history, and politics as specifically Ukrainian. Wilson has succeeded admirably in providing a detailed and judicious study of the current ideas that make up Ukrainian national identity."&#x2014;Virginia Quarterly Review "A lively, detailed, and eminently sensible exploration of who the Ukrainians are and why they are important . . . required reading for anyone with a serious interest in Eastern Europe."&#x2014;Anna Reid, Literary Review "[A] sweeping introductory examination of Ukrainian identity and history. . . .

The literary equivalent of naive painting, it narrates the adventures of a respectable upper middle-aged man who takes retirement.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;<strong>An antidote to the rush of the early 21st century</strong>.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;A thoroughly enjoyable stroll through a vanished England with some lovable characters. <strong>Don't expect modern, fashionable agonisings, here there is good, evil, and understanding.</strong> A lovely reminiscent wallow of a read.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Gentle well told simple story, full of pleasant surprises, and a mild mannered believable hero. <strong>Loved it to bits</strong>.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;<strong>So gentle, it hurts</strong>.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;<strong>There is a freshness about the writing</strong> which is charming and that disarms criticism.

The overall approach is designed to start with basic concepts and procedures and to gradually build more advanced levels, strengthening the students understanding and skills through the process.<p> <i>Microbiology Laboratory Fundamentals and Applications</i> provides students beginning their study with functional and effective experiences that will enable them to work with, understand, and appreciate the importance of microorganisms to basic life processes. The exercises have been chosen, designed, and arranged to help students learn to observe and to recognize fundamental similarities and differences among microorganisms. The second edition of <i>Microbiology Laboratory Fundamentals and Applications</i> contains a number of new illustrations, exercise improvements, and new up-to date procedures. The elements of critical thinking have also been interwoven within the various exercises and experiments to build and to add to the scientific perspective and abilities of students. </p> <p><b>Learning Aids</b></p> <p> To make this manual an effective tool for students, we have developed and incorporated a number of learning aids. These include: </p> <p> <b> <i>Pronunciation Guide to Organisms.</i></b><i> </i> The scientific names of each organism studied are presented in a way to aid the student in acquiring a greater ease with which to discuss, describe, and use microorganisms. A phonetic pronunciation guide is listed on the front and back inside covers of this manual. These lists contain all organisms discussed and/or used. In addition, the phonetic pronunciation of an organism's <i>genus</i> and <i>species</i> is given the first time the organism appears in the manual. </p> <p> <b> <i>Section Overviews.</i></b><i> </i> Each major section of the laboratory manual is preceded by a description of the range of topics and experiments to be covered. </p> <p> <b> <i>Learning Objectives.</i></b><i> </i> Each exercise begins with a list of learning objectives to emphasize the purpose of the procedures and what the student is to accomplish. </p> <p> <b> <i>Illustrations.</i></b><i> </i> More than 500 photographs and diagrams have been incorporated into the manual to provide a clear and functional understanding of techniques, properties of microorganisms, and specific test results. </p> <p> <b> <i>Procedure Diagrams.</i></b><i> </i> Exercises that introduce basic techniques contain step-by-step illustrations of the procedures to show the proper handling of equipment and cultures. An alphabetical listing of <i>Procedure Diagrams</i> can be found on pages xix-xx. </p> <p> <b> <i>Referral Boxes.</i></b><i> </i> In exercises requiring the use of specific procedures and/or techniques described in other parts of the laboratory manual, special Referral Boxes have been inserted to help students to quickly locate needed procedures. </p> <p> <b> <i>Laboratory Review and Critical Thinking Corner.</i></b><i> </i> <i>Laboratory Reviews</i> accompany all exercises to help students determine whether they understood the major features of the exercise and related topics. Several exercises also contain <i>Critical Thinking Corners.</i> Here the student is expected to answer questions, quite frequently accompanied by illustrations, pertaining to specific results or concepts of the exercise. Answers to these sections can be found in Appendix 1. </p> <p> <b> <i>Key Terms.</i></b><i> </i> Each exercise contains a specific section of definitions together with the phonetic pronunciations of selected terms. </p> <p> <b> <i>Experimental Exercises.</i></b><i> </i> A separate section containing a number of specially developed exercises, techniques, and applications can be found at the end of the manual. These exercises lend themselves to experimentation and additional applications of the principles of microbiology and molecular biology. </p> <p> <b> <i>Index.</i></b><i> </i> An index has been included in this manual because of the large number of tests and procedures it contains. Students should have no difficulty in locating a particular test or procedure. </p> <p><b>Organization of the Manual</b></p> <p> The 66 instructional exercises, 4 experimental exercises, and related items in this manual are arranged into 15 sections, as follows: </p> <p> <i>Microbiology Laboratory Fundamentals and Applications</i> begins with a short visual survey of equipment generally used in a microbiology laboratory. Familiarity with these and the other equipment items presented in specific exercises will contribute to a smoother-operating laboratory. </p> <p> Section I teaches certain fundamental procedures used in microscopy and in the study of microorganisms. These procedures include oil-immersion objective usage, smear preparations, simple staining, and hanging-drop and temporary wet-mount techniques. </p> <p> Section II stresses methods employed in the isolation and study of both aerobic and anaerobic microbial cultures. Dilution techniques and the use of pipettes together with an application of the pour technique to determine colony-farming units of cultures also are included. </p> <p> Section III compares the representative microbial groups, which include bacteria, algae, protozoa, and fungi, as to their structure, morphological arrangement, and selected activities. Exercises in the section also deal with the distribution of microorganisms in the environment, and spontaneous generation. Microscopic measurements and an examination of Leeuwenhoek's peppercorn water also are important aspects of this section. </p> <p> Section IV demonstrates specific staining techniques, such as the Gram stain and acid-fast procedures, which are used in the identification and classification of bacteria. Both the hot and cold forms of acid-fast staining techniques are presented. </p> <p> Section V familiarizes students with the structure and function of bacterial cells. Techniques used to observe flagella and bacterial motility by means of motility agar are included. </p> <p> Section VI demonstrates the extracellular and intracellular metabolic activities of bacteria. The section begins with a comparison of various selective and differential plating media and then proceeds to the use of a number of tube and plate media to show the enzymatic activities of various bacterial species. The use of rapid and miniaturized testing procedures to identify microorganisms is also covered. The section ends by introducing the use of a biochemical flowchart (key) in the identification of an unknown enteric bacterial species. </p> <p> Section VII stresses the principles of sterilization and disinfection and the effectiveness of chemical and physical agents in the control of microorganisms. Particular attention is given to the thermal resistance of microorganisms, the use of ultraviolet light in sterilization and as a mutagenic agent, and the inhibitory actions of dyes, different pH levels, and heavy metals. Antibiotic sensitivity testing and the detection of antibiotic resistance also are demonstrated. </p> <p> Section VIII emphasizes certain properties of viruses. Both bacterial and animal viruses are studied and techniques for their detection and cultivation are included. </p> <p> Section IX includes exercises involving gene transfer processes found in bacteria. Experiments contain safe procedures designed to present the basic features of bacterial transformation, conjugation, and transduction. Rapid colony transformation with plasmid DNA and the application of the Ames test for the detection of mutations and/or cancer-causing chemicals also are contained in this section. </p> <p> Section X demonstrates some of the industrial applications of microorganisms. Exercises covering the distribution of microbes in food and their involvement in the production of sauerkraut, cheese, yogurt, and wine are included. </p> <p> Section XI contains exercises designed to increase students' understanding of basic immunological principles and their application. Modifications of standard procedures and concepts and a survey of commercially available tests are presented. Such tests include a survey of commercially available diagnostic devices. The section begins with microbial agglution reactions and concludes with an enzyme immunoassay. </p> <p> Section XII provides a number of exercises dealing with epidemiology. Particular topics covered include a demonstration of Koch's postulates, the effectiveness of universal precautions, and the proper handling of specimens and their transport. Consideration also is given to aerosols and their importance to laboratory and hospital sepsis. </p> <p> Section XIII includes exercises relating to several aspects of basic medical microbiology. Experiments dealing with the normal flora (<i>microbiota</i>) of the body demonstrate that the presence of microbes on or in the body is not necessarily indicative of disease. Procedures for handling and identifying various unknown laboratory specimens are considered. In addition, representative disease-producing microorganisms and procedures used for their identification and study are stressed in specific exercises. </p> <p> Section XIV provides an introduction to the fundamental areas of medical helminthology. The distinguishing features of helminths and arthropods associated with specific infectious diseases are considered. </p> <p> Section XV presents a number of experimental exercises that reinforce critical thinking and the scientific method. Several of the topics considered lend themselves to class demonstrations and to special student projects. The exercises include topics such as determining the effects of temperature on the bacterial growth curve, immunoelectrophoresis, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and DNA restriction analyses. </p> <p><b>Instructor's Manual</b></p> <p> An updated <i>Instructor's Manual</i> to accompany the <i>Laboratory Manual</i> is available and contains specific directions for the preparation of laboratory materials, alternate procedures, the use of supplementary aids, suggested sources for 4udiovisual aids, laboratory equipment and supplies, questions for laboratory examinations and quizzes, and answers to exercise Laboratory Review questions. </p> <p> George A.

Pat Conroy (<i>The Prince of Tides</i>) says the author of <i>Low Country, Up Island, Peachtree Street, </i>and <i>King&#x2019;s Oak</i> &#x201c;ranks among the best of us,&#x201d; and the <i>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</i> praises <i>Nora, Nora </i>as &#x201c;Anne Rivers Siddons writing at the top of her form. This lively, sparkling coming-of-age novel is superbly written and wholly engaging.&#x201d;</p></p><p>The young heroine of <i>Nora, Nora</i> comes from a long line of angst-ridden adolescents, stretching back through Holden Caulfield and Frankie Addams to Huckleberry Finn. Yet Peyton McKenzie certainly has good reason to be unhappy. Her household, in the small Georgia town of Lytton, is shadowed by the deaths of her mother and older brother. Her father, meanwhile, has withdrawn into mournful distraction: "When Buddy died in an accident in his air-force trainer, when Peyton was five, Frazier McKenzie closed up shop on his laughter, anger, small foolishnesses, and large passions. Now, at twelve, Peyton could remember no other father than the cooled and static one she had."<p> To withstand this mortuary atmosphere--not to mention a touch of small-town claustrophobia--Peyton has founded the Losers Club, where she and two other misfits share their daily doses of unhappiness. But everything changes when her cousin Nora shows up for a visit. This jaunty outsider is unlike anybody else in Kennedy-era Lytton, circa 1961: </p><blockquote> The first thing you noticed about Nora Findlay, Peyton thought, was that she gave off heat, a kind of sheen, like a wild animal, except that hers was not a dangerous ferality, but an aura of sleekness and high spirits. There was a padding, hip-shot prowl to her walk, and she moved her body as if she were totally unconscious of it, as if its suppleness and sinew were something she had lived with all her life. </blockquote> At first Nora's high spirits have a tonic effect, jogging both Peyton and her father out of their torpor. But her involvement in racial politics eventually rubs some of Lytton's citizens the wrong way--and puts her young cousin's loyalty to the test. Anne Rivers Siddons handles the narrative with a deft touch for local color (right down to the perpetual "three Coca-Colas in an old red metal ice chest"). But her feeling for her cast of characters is even better, mixing just the right proportions of delicacy and Southern discomfort. <i>--Anita Urquhart</i>7 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Energy, Environment, and Climate</h2><p><p><strong>Emphasizes climate change as an energy-related environmental issue.</strong></p><em>Energy, Environment, and Climate</em>, Second Edition, is the most contemporary book for the energy course.

The Library of America volume&nbsp;<i>Novels 1956&#x2013;1964</i>&nbsp;opens with&nbsp;<i>Seize the Day</i>, a tightly wrought novella that, unfolding over the course of a single devastating day, explores the desperate predicament of the failed actor and salesman Tommy Wilhelm. The austere psychological portraiture of&nbsp;<i>Seize the Day&nbsp;</i>is followed by an altogether different book,&nbsp;<i>Henderson the Rain King</i>, the ebullient tale of the irresistible eccentric Eugene Henderson, best characterized by his primal mantra &#x201c;I want! I want!&#x201d; Beneath the novel&#x2019;s comic surface lies an affecting parable of one man&#x2019;s quest to know himself and come to terms with morality; like Don Quixote, Henderson is, as Bellow later described him, &#x201c;an absurd seeker of high qualities.&#x201d;<br><br>Henderson&#x2019;s irrepressible vitality is matched by that of Moses Herzog, the eponymous hero of Bellow&#x2019;s best-selling 1964 novel. His wife having abandoned him for his best friend, Herzog is on the verge of mental collapse and has embarked on a furious letter-writing campaign as an outlet for his all-consuming rage. Bellow&#x2019;s bravura performance in&nbsp;<i>Herzog</i>&nbsp;launched a new phase of his career, as literary acclaim was now joined by a receptive mass audience in America.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing. The Library of America series includes more than 300 volumes to date, authoritative editions that average 1,000 pages in length, feature cloth covers, sewn bindings, and ribbon markers, and are printed on premium acid-free paper that will last for centuries.</p><p><b>Saul Bellow&nbsp;</b>was born of Russian Jewish parents in Lachine, Quebec in 1915, and was raised in Chicago. His works include&nbsp;<b>The Adventures of Augie March</b>, which went on to win the National Book Award for fiction in 1954,&nbsp;<b>Seize the Day</b>&nbsp;(1956);&nbsp;<b>Henderson the Rain King</b>&nbsp;(1959); and&nbsp;<b>Humboldt's Gift</b>&nbsp;(1975), which won the Pulitzer Prize. In 1976 Bellow was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature "for the human understanding and subtle analysis of contemporary culture that are combined in his work."&nbsp;In 2003, he became just the second living writer to have his works published in the Library of America series. He died in 2005.<br><br><b>James Wood</b>, editor, is a staff writer at&nbsp;<i>The New Yorker</i>&nbsp;and author of&nbsp;<i>The Irresponsible Self: On Laughter and the Novel&nbsp;</i>(2004),&nbsp;<i>The Broken Estate: Essays on Literature and Belief</i>(1999), and the novel&nbsp;<i>The Book Against God</i>&nbsp;(2003).Nobel Prize winning author and acclaimed playwright Bellow has an indelible place in American letters. This compendium, the second in a series edited by Wood, follows a 1944-1953 collection, and includes three prominent novels-Seize the Day, Henderson the Rain King and Herzog-considered some of the finest examples of post-war American literature. Dark, devastating and funny, Bellow's writing reflects the solitude and isolation of the immigrant experience-a Russian-Jewish �migr�, Bellow grew up in the Jewish ghettos of Canada, and then Chicago-as well as the troubled predicament of Judaism in post-war society. Wood, a senior editor of the New Republic, co-taught with Bellow at Boston University; he provides annotation and a helpful chronology of Bellow's life, placing these three works into context. Readers interested in analysis may be disappointed, as by and large Wood lets the text speak for itself, but the supplementary material will prove instructive for any reader, irrespective of their familiarity with the material. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

What are the characteristics of oppressive conceptual frameworks and systems of unjustified domination? How does an ecofeminist perspective help one understand issues of environmental and social justice? In this important new work, Karen J. Warren answers these and other questions from a Western perspective. Warren looks at the variety of positions in ecofeminism, the distinctive nature of ecofeminist philosophy, ecofeminism as an ecological position, and other aspects of the movement to reveal its significance to both understanding and creatively changing patriarchal (and other) systems of unjustified domination.</p><p><b>Karen J. Warren</b> is professor of philosophy at Macalester College.Warren has provided a useful book for feminist and environmental philosophy instruction. She makes a number of interesting arguments in very accessible ways in chapters on vegeterianism, social justice, spirituality, and ecofeminism as a particularly Western philosophical movement. This informative overview and set of arguments about ecofeminism as a productive philosophical and social movement is a very useful resource for academic libraries. (<i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>Warren is a key thinker in this field, and the philosophical enquiry here is exemplary in its detail: terms are rigorously defined, arguments move by careful and clearly indicated steps, and the material is presented with painstaking care for thorough explanation. (<i>Feminist Theory</i>)<br><br>This is a welcome project, as a philosophically inclined yet accessible introductory book on ecofeminism is long overdue, and especially welcome from an established ecofeminist. (<i>Environmental Values</i>)<br><br>This book is highly recommended especially for those who believe that ecofeminism has a lot to offer in guiding attempts to reach a greener society. (<i>Environmental Politics</i>)<br><br>A well-organized explication of the ideology that perpetuates the domination of women and nature. It would make an excellent introductory textbook for a class on environmental philosophy, feminist studies, or ecofeminism. It is clear and concise. Because of its accessible style, the book will serve particularly well as an introduction to ecofeminism. Finally, because of the discussions regarding moral pluralism and the reconciliation of holism with individualism, the book also captures a somewhat higher level of intellectual interest. <i>Ecofeminist Philosphy</i> embodies a rare blend of accessibility and wide-ranging synthesis of debates in the field. Even more rare is her analysis opening onto avenues for further inquiry, which renders the book highly recommendable for almost anyone to read, whether student, philosopher, feminist, environmentalist, or simply the curious.

But when she first placed her hands on the barre at an after-school community center, no one expected the undersized, underprivileged, and anxious thirteen-year-old to become one of America&#x2019;s most groundbreaking dancers . A true prodigy, she was attempting in months roles that take most dancers years to master. But when Misty became caught between the control and comfort she found in the world of ballet and the harsh realities of her own life, she had to choose to embrace both her identity and her dreams, and find the courage to be one of a kind.<br> <br>With an insider&#x2019;s passion, Misty opens a window into the life of an artist who lives life center stage, from behind the scenes at her first classes to her triumphant roles in some of the world&#x2019;s most iconic ballets.

EIGHT A.M., to be exact. My alarm goes off for no more than five seconds before I sit up to stop the nagging sound.<br> <br>As I stretch my arms, I realize how achy my body is. Still, it&#x2019;s a wonderful aching every dancer knows.<br> <br>As many busy New Yorkers do, I click a few buttons on my computer and order my morning coffee&#x2014;black, no sugar&#x2014;and blueberry muffin from the corner deli to be delivered to the door of my Upper West Side apartment. Class starts at ten thirty at the Met.<br> <br>The ordinary rituals of my day belie what will be an extraordinary evening. I&#x2019;m eager for this day to start so that, later, I can rise again, this time on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera House.<br> <br>Tonight, I will become the first black woman to star in Igor Stravinsky&#x2019;s iconic role for American Ballet Theatre, one of the most prestigious dance companies in the world.<br> <br>As the Firebird.<br> <br>This is for the little brown girls.<br> <br>My barre warm-up this morning would be familiar to any ballet dancer, whether she&#x2019;s an apprentice in Moscow or a seven-year-old taking his first ballet class in Detroit. It&#x2019;s slow structured yet fragmentary&#x2014;perfectly designed to bring me to center, where I can dance freely without the barre, each motion a broken-down version of what tonight&#x2019;s solos will be. I start with pli�s, increasingly deeper bends of the knee which warm up my legs while still allowing them the support that they need. I transition to larger movements of the leg, circling them in my ronds de jambe, and bending them in fondus, gradually stretching my hips and knees. I finish with a port de bras, stretching my torso forward and from side to side.<br> <br>I move to center, where each aerobic exercise moves more fluidly to the next without the barre&#x2019;s strictures. I know that each graceful glissade&#x2014;where I jump in first position with both legs flicking to a dagger before closing into fifth&#x2014;stems from that disengaged brush of the leg where my foot leaves the floor, which stems from a tendu, a single pointed toe that I&#x2019;ve extended while maintaining contact with the floor.<br> <br>Ballets are just stylized versions of these seemingly basic movements on a grand scale. If the basic strength and elegance of a barre class is like slipping on a little black dress, the challenge of dancing a full three-act ballet is like learning to accessorize for any occasion. I have to think about whether I want to add sass or longing or, as I will tonight, the exotic, otherworldly energy of the mythical Firebird.<br> <br>You have to know the appropriate way to adorn each story and character with your body. Sleeping Beauty, for example, is very elegant and regal; its movements are fluid, with few accents. There are certain ways you have to hold your torso, position your head, and use your arms as a certain character that can differ from what I rehearse in class. The difference between being an amazing technician and being a soloist or principal is mastering those interpretive flourishes to tell the best story. Otherwise you aren&#x2019;t a ballerina&#x2014;you&#x2019;re just another dancer.<br> <br>No matter how old you are or how long you&#x2019;ve been dancing, ballet professionals know that we have to repeat these steps in class every day to maintain the strength and the clean positioning that&#x2019;s so essential to dancers. I&#x2019;m constantly working on my technique. Even a single day off can cause my muscles to forget what my mind knows by heart. I take class seven days a week, even though the company only works five days each week.<br> <br>I know that I&#x2019;ll never perfect the ballet technique&#x2014;ever. That&#x2019;s why I love it so much. It never becomes boring, even though I&#x2019;ve done all these movements in this very studio a million times over thirteen years. It&#x2019;s my safe place, where I can experiment. I sweat, grunt, and make faces that would never pass on the Metropolitan Opera House stage. It&#x2019;s the time to push myself beyond my limits so that my performances can feel �effortless, fresh.<br> <br>Not everyone wants to push themselves to that brink of breaking, but it&#x2019;s what you commit to when you&#x2019;re a professional&#x2014;the very present reality that you may break instead of bend.<br> <br>Today, I don&#x2019;t jump. My left shin has been hurting, and I don&#x2019;t want to risk straining it before tonight&#x2019;s performance.<br> <br>I have always been known as a jumper, able to soar to great heights and land like a feather on the stage. The Firebird flutters and flies. But it has been difficult to practice her grand jumps the past several weeks. The pain in my leg has been intense, and I&#x2019;ve had to save every bit of my strength for the actual performances.<br> <br>By now, I am as familiar with the feral gestures of the Firebird as I am with my own breath, my own heartbeat. American Ballet Theatre&#x2019;s spring season has been under way for six weeks, with two more to go, and I&#x2019;ve previously performed as the Firebird twice in Southern California, barely an hour away from my hometown.<br> <br>I have a light rehearsal around noon at the Met, to space the choreography and get the feel of the stage. I want to be sure that I hit all of my marks, that I&#x2019;m always in the right place so I don&#x2019;t collide with the corps de ballet during my variations or move out of sync with my partner when we dance our pas de deux.<br> <br>When the public walks into the hallowed space of the Metropolitan Opera, it sees its gilded foyer, its luxe patron boxes, and its grand stage. But behind the scenes there are studio spaces where performers can hone their magic, eking out a final practice before the show begins.<br> <br>I spend part of the afternoon in one of those rooms for a private rehearsal with Alexei Ratmansky, Firebird&#x2019;s choreographer.<br> <br>Alexei, ever the visionary and perfectionist, is changing the choreography up until the last minute. He tweaks a leap here, a twist there. We go through all my solos to ensure that the counts are exactly right.<br> <br>Beat one. On my toes.<br> <br>Beat two. Dart to the right.<br> <br>Beat three. Bound through the air.<br> <br>Alexei changes my entrance to the stage several times before we finally agree on the steps that best suit me. There are two other casts, and the Firebird&#x2019;s entrance in each is different, difficult, unique. I feel energized. I feel ready.<br> <br>This is for the little brown girls.<br> <br>I walk home to my apartment, a dozen blocks from the Met. I shower and flip to the Food Network just to have some background noise as I try to relax my mind, wind down my body.<br> <br>A couple hours later, I&#x2019;m back at the Met. The curtain won&#x2019;t go up until seven thirty p.m., and I won&#x2019;t take the stage until nine, but I want to be early, to not have to rush.<br> <br>It is a special evening, and not just for me. Kevin McKenzie, ABT&#x2019;s artistic director, is also being honored. It is his twentieth anniversary in that role, and in celebration there will be speeches, a video tribute featuring congratulations from the artistic directors of nearly every major classical company in the world, and performances by all of ABT&#x2019;s principal dancers.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s getting close to showtime. I have been a soloist for five years, and the eleven of us have a dressing room all to ourselves. But I have never used it. I prefer the comforting camaraderie of the dressing area shared by the corps. I spent six years as part of the corps de ballet, and with them I want to remain, preparing for my first principal role in a classical ballet surrounded by loving friends. Nothing feels different between us, even though I&#x2019;ll dance the lead. That, at least, provides normalcy on this extraordinary night.<br> <br>I have my own corner of the dressing room, claimed long ago. The table is so crowded with flowers and chocolates and photographs that there is barely room for me to squeeze my cell phone. There are bouquets of orchids, my favorite, and dozens of roses. Arthur Mitchell, the founder of Dance Theatre of Harlem, has left me a voice mail, wishing me luck. There are dozens more e-mails, texts, and cards&#x2014;from friends, family, and fans all over the country&#x2014;wishing me well.<br> <br>Looking at the beautiful bounty, I start to get emotional. But I can&#x2019;t be distracted. I can&#x2019;t be overwhelmed.<br> <br>This is for the little brown girls.<br> <br>I go into hair and makeup about a half hour after the evening performance starts. In the mirror, Misty disappears and a mystical creature takes her place, its face dusted with red glitter and painted with dazzling red spirals that shoot from the corners of its eyes. Even my inch-long false lashes are colored red. One of the company&#x2019;s dressers slicks back my hair into a smooth swirl to better attach my red and gold plume.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good luck, Misty,&#x201d; a dancer hollers at me with a smile.<br> <br>&#x201c;Merde!&#x201d; one yells.<br> <br>&#x201c;Enjoy it!&#x201d; says another.<br> <br>I know that they wholeheartedly mean what they say. But those are everyday salutations that can be tossed out before any night&#x2019;s performance. They don&#x2019;t reflect the monumental nature of this evening, what it means to me and the rest of the African American community.<br> <br>Maybe no words could.<br> <br>Fifteen minutes.<br> <br>I plop down on the floor of the dressing area&#x2019;s lounge, stretching, flexing, staring at myself in the mirror. I stamp that thought down as quickly as it emerges. I think to myself, This is it, this is my moment. Finally, the moment to shine, to prove myself, to represent black dancers at the highest level of ballet.<br> <br>This is for the little brown girls.<br> <br>But my shin is throbbing uncontrollably.<br> <br>I know deep down that I can&#x2019;t go on much longer with such pain. Tonight will be the first time I perform as the Firebird in New York, and I pray it won&#x2019;t be my last. By the time Firebird is up, ABT has performed several other pieces and two intermissions have paused the program.<br> <br>I make my way toward the stage. Kevin McKenzie, the conductor, and the rest of ABT&#x2019;s artistic staff are standing there, behind the curtain, wishing me luck.<br> <br>I remember the first time I stood on the stage at the Metropolitan Opera House. I was nineteen years old, still struggling to find my place in ABT&#x2019;s corps de ballet. I traced the marley floor with my pointe shoes and imagined myself on the stage, not as a member of the corps, but as a principal dancer. It felt right. It felt like a promise: someday, somehow, it was going to happen for me.<br> <br>A decade later, I am here, waiting for the moment when I will explode onto the stage in a burst of red and gold.<br> <br>Outside, the largest crowd I have ever seen waits. Prominent members of the African American community and trailblazers in the world of dance who have seldom received their due are here tonight: Arthur Mitchell, Debra Lee, Star Jones, Nelson George . . . but I know I will also dance for those who aren&#x2019;t here, who have never seen a ballet, who pass the Metropolitan Opera House but cannot imagine what goes on inside. They may be poor, like I have been; insecure, like I have been; misunderstood, like I have been. I will be dancing for them, too. Especially for them.<br> <br>This is for the little brown girls.<br> <br>I stand in the farthest upstage wing when the curtain rises. There are a flock of &#x201c;Firebirds&#x201d; who enter the stage first after Ivan, the prince. I can feel the anticipation rolling off the crowd as they pose and preen. They expect me to be among them. I take a deep breath. The music starts, and with it comes the cheers, a great roar of love from the audience.<br> <br>I realize in that moment that it doesn&#x2019;t matter what I do on the stage tonight. They are all here for me, with me, here for who I am and what tonight represents. I run onto the stage and feel myself transform. As I approach center, my flock parts, leaving me to stand alone. There&#x2019;s a brief second of silence before the audience erupts into applause once more, clapping so loudly I can barely hear the music.<br> <br>And so it begins.</p><h2>AWHONN&#39;s Perinatal Nursing</h2><p><b>An official publication of the Association of Women&#x2019;s Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN), Perinatal Nursing, Fourth Edition</b> presents up-to-date information based on the most rigorous evidence and offers suggestions for best practices.

New, up-to-date issues covered include the removal of dams, global warming, emerging diseases among elk and deer, adaptive harvest management, animal rights groups, women hunters, population data, migratory animals and more. <b> </b> For anyone interested in an exceptionally comprehensive introduction to wildlife management and conservation. </p></p><p>Featuring the most comprehensive coverage of any competing text, the new edition continues to expose students to the ecological principles, practices and prescriptions used to restore and manage wildlife and related natural resources. Throughout the text current wildlife management issues, as well as related resource and other environmental issues, are discussed at length.<p> For nearly 20 years, <i>Wildlife Ecology and Management</i> has endured as a basic text in its field and, because of its continuing acceptance, we pleased to present the fifth edition. Despite the intervening years, however, our goal remains unchanged. Namely, we wish to introduce undergraduate students to wildlife management by presenting a broad overview across a spectrum of topics&#x2014;wildlife diseases to public policy, exotic introductions to forest management, and predation to urban wildlife. These students, we hope, will include not only those completing degrees in disciplines associated with the conservation of natural resources&#x2014;forestry, range and watershed management, outdoor recreation, as well as wildlife management&#x2014;but also those "nonmajors" from other academic areas. Our presentation accordingly does not assume that students have acquired more than modest exposure to the biological sciences. The Glossary remains a major element in the fifth edition, as does a fundamental treatment of ecology in Chapter 4. </p> <p><b>WHAT'S NEW</b></p> <p> We sought new studies&#x2014;especially those appearing in the most recent three to four years prior to press time&#x2014;to revitalize concepts already presented in the book or to present entirely new areas of interest. Among the latter is the removal of dams, not only to restore fish runs, but also to restore, as much as possible, the biota and functions of entire watersheds to their former state. Similarly, this edition includes an overview of global warming in relation to wildlife management and highlights the occurrence of emerging diseases such as chronic wasting disease in deer and elk. We also describe adaptive harvest management&#x2014;a performance-based strategy for regulating the influence of hunting on wildlife populations&#x2014;and draw attention to the influence of animal rights groups as well as to the responsibilities of hunters. Continued broadening of the term <i>wildlife</i> also is reflected in this edition, including expanded coverage of marine mammals and concerns for species such as bog turtles and monarch butterflies. </p> <p> In all, more than 390 new references are cited, of which 71 percent bear dates of 1999 to 2002. Still, older literature often remains the best source to establish a strong and necessary foundation for many subjects, and the implications and results reported in these earlier papers are no less true today than when they first appeared in the literature (e.g., DDT-induced eggshell thinning). Interests also shift through time, and some areas currently attract little, if any, attention. Invasive species have stimulated an avalanche of literature, for example, but wildlife economics and soil-animal ecology have not, and our attempt to update these and some other subjects has not always been fulfilled satisfactorily. </p> <p> New information boxes describe additional institutions dedicated to wildlife research and management, and another new box features an influential conservationist from yesteryear. As in the past, we complement these with profiles of colleagues who work "in the real world" where problems of funding, politics, and bureaucratic limitations pose daily challenges to their work. </p></p><h2>Inside War: The Guerrilla Conflict in Missouri During the American Civil War</h2><p>During the Civil War, the state of Missouri witnessed the most widespread, prolonged, and destructive guerrilla fighting in American history. With its horrific combination of robbery, arson, torture, murder, and swift and bloody raids on farms and settlements, the conflict approached total war, engulfing the whole populace and challenging any notion of civility. Michael Fellman's <em>Inside War</em> captures the conflict from "inside," drawing on a wealth of first-hand evidence, including letters, diaries, military reports, court-martial transcripts, depositions, and newspaper accounts. He gives us a clear picture of the ideological, social, and economic forces that divided the people and launched the conflict. Along with depicting how both Confederate and Union officials used the guerrilla fighters and their tactics to their own advantage, Fellman describes how ordinary civilian men and women struggled to survive amidst the random terror perpetuated by both sides; what drove the combatants themselves to commit atrocities and vicious acts of vengeance; and how the legend of Jesse James arose from this brutal episode in the American Civil War.<br></p><p>During the Civil War, the state of Missouri witnessed the most wide spread, prolonged, and destructive guerrilla fighting in American history.

His surveys are accurate and his critiques are pointed, insightful, and fair, consistently calling the educator to examine each of the theories in light of one's biblical and theological framework. . . .

But a strange turn of fate from an unexpected direction forces Jones to upend his existence and spend all of his time in pursuit of another man&#x2019;s ludicrous dream. Can there be salmon in the Yemen? Science says no. But if resources are limitless and the visionary is inspired, maybe salmon fishing in the Yemen isn&#x2019;t impossible. Then again, maybe nothing is.</p><p>British businessman and dedicated angler Paul Torday has found a way to combine a novel about fishing and all that it means with a satire involving politics, bureaucrats, the Middle East, the war in Iraq, and a sheikh who is really a mystic. Torday makes it all work in a most convincing way using memos, interviews, e-mails, and letters in clever juxtaposition. <p> Dr. Alfred Jones is a fisheries scientist in Great Britain who is called upon to find a way to introduce salmon into the desert in Yemen. The Yemeni sheikh will spare no expense to see this happen. He says: </p><p> </p><blockquote>It would be a miracle of God if it happened. I know it... If God wills it, the summer rains will fill the wadis... and the salmon will run the river. And then my countrymen... all classes and manner of men--will stand side by side and fish for the salmon. And their natures, too, will be changed. They will feel the enchantment of this silver fish... and then when talk turns to what this tribe said or that tribe did... then someone will say, "Let us arise, and go fishing."</blockquote> <p> Such is the sheikh's vision. He tells Alfred: "Without faith, there is no hope. Without faith, there is no love." Alfred has no religious faith and has been mired in a loveless marriage for twenty years, so these words seem fantastic to him. </p><p> Alfred and Sheikh Muhammad connect immediately through their mutual love of fishing, despite Alfred's misgivings about the viability of the project. The Prime Minister's flack man tells Alfred that he must persevere and succeed because Great Britain needs some positive connection to the Middle East, something other than a failing, flailing war. These kinds of political alliances are always shaky at best, and when things start to go sideways, allies have a way of disappearing. Alfred soldiers on, with the help of the lovely Harriet, Sheikh Muhammad's land agent, and the project is readied for opening day, when the Sheikh and the Prime Minister will have a 20-minute photo op. </p><p> All of the faith and good will in the world cannot overcome the forces ranged against them, bringing tragedy to everyone involved. Despite all, Alfred's interior life is changed immeasurably. He says in the end: "I believe in it, because it is impossible." <i>--Valerie Ryan</i></p>Published in hardcover by Harcourt, 2007, <b>978-0-15-101276-3</b>/0-15-101276-8</p><h2>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (Word Cloud Classics)</h2><p>No home library is complete without the classics! <i>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</i> is a keepsake to be read and treasured.<br><br><i>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</i>, a collection of twelve short stories by Scottish author Arthur Conan Doyle, is considered a milestone in the genre of detective fiction.

Drawing on exclusive access to Mark Rothko's personal papers and over one hundred interviews with artists, patrons, and dealers, James Breslin tells the story of a life in art&#x2014;the personal costs and professional triumphs, the convergence of genius and ego, the clash of culture and commerce. Breslin offers us not only an enticing look at Rothko as a person, but delivers a lush, in-depth portrait of the New York art scene of the 1930s, &#x2019;40s, and &#x2019;50s&#x2014;the world of Abstract Expressionism, of Pollock, Rothko, de Kooning, and Klein, which would influence artists for generations to come.</p><br>"In Breslin, Rothko has the ideal biographer&#x2014;thorough but never tedious, a good storyteller with an ear for the spoken word, fond but not fawning, and possessed of a most rare ability to comment on non-representational art without sounding preposterous."&#x2014;Robert Kiely, <i>Boston Book Review</i><br><br>"Breslin impressively recreates Mark Rothko's troubled nature, his tormented life, and his disturbing canvases. . . . The artist's paintings become almost tangible within Breslin's pages, and Rothko himself emerges as an alarming physical force."&#x2014;Robert Warde, <i>Hungry Mind Review</i><br><br>"This remains beyond question the finest biography so far devoted to an artist of the New York School."-Arthur C. Danto, <i>Boston Sunday Globe</i><br><br>"Clearly written, full of intelligent insights, and thorough."&#x2014;Hayden Herrera, <i>Art in America</i><br><br>"Breslin spent seven years working on this book, and he has definitely done his homework."-Nancy M. Barnes, <i>Boston Phoenix</i><br><br>"He's made the tragedy of his subject's life the more poignant."&#x2014;Eric Gibson, <i>The New Criterion</i><br><br>"Mr. Breslin's book is, in my opinion, the best life of an American painter that has yet been written . . . a biographical classic. It is painstakingly researched, fluently written and unfailingly intelligent in tracing the tragic course of its subject's tormented character."&#x2014;Hilton Kramer, <i>New York Times Book Review</i>, front page review<br><br>James E. B. Breslin (1936-1996) was professor of English at the University of California, Berkeley, and author of <i>From Modern to Contemporary: American Poetry, 1945-1965</i> and <i>William Carlos Williams: An American Artist</i>.</p><p>"I became a painter because I wanted to raise painting to the level of poignancy of music and poetry." Born Marcus Rothkowitz in a small Russian town, Mark Rothko immigrated to Portland, Oregon, in 1913, when he was 10 years old. "You don't know what it is to be a Jewish kid dressed in a suit that is a Dvinsk, not an American, idea of a suit traveling across America and not able to speak English," he later told fellow abstract expressionist Robert Motherwell. Rothko was a weak child, an abandoned son (his father had gone to America in 1910 and died of cancer just seven months after the family was reunited), a Jew excluded from high school clubs, a Yale freshman on scholarship, and a college dropout determined to become an Artist with a capital <i>A</i>. James Breslin has written an exhaustive biography of the painter. He pulled together all the facts of Rothko's life and carefully examined all the strata of the artist's personality--Rothko's sensitivity, his sense of displacement, his pride and his diffidence, his combativeness, his love for his children, his hatred for Marlborough Gallery director Frank Lloyd, and his difficulties with money. The book is flawed only by Breslin's ticlike use of italics, which give the sense of the author tugging at our sleeve in an unnecessary effort to persuade: "Rothko's last and most severe renunciations were made not to remove obstacles between the observer and the idea but in a gesture of personal <i>withdrawal</i>." But this is a relatively minor trifle that does not unduly detract from this large--and large-spirited--book about a tormented, brilliant Artist. <i>--Peggy Moorman</i><p><b>James E. B. Breslin</b> (1935-1996) was a professor of English and chair of the Department of Art Practice at the University of California at Berkeley, where he served on the faculty for thirty-two years. <br><br>His lifelong interest as a scholar lay in twentieth century American poetry and art. His first book was <i>William Carlos Williams: An American Artist</i>, published by the University of Chicago Press in 1970. This was followed by <i>From Modern to Contemporary</i>, which the Press published in 1984. <i>Mark Rothko: A Biography</i>, which the Press first released in 1993 is his best-known book, and marked a turn from poetry to American painting at its most radical moment: the emergence of Abstract Expressionism, displayed and explored in the career and life of one of its masters. </p></p><h2>The Wall Street Journal.

They then turn around and take the very same money you deposited, combine it with deposits from other folks, and lend the money to your neighbor, charging that borrower a higher rate of interest than the bank charges you. The difference between those two interest rates&#x2014;the so-called spread&#x2014;is where banks generally make their money. <br><br>Businesses deal with commercial banks; consumers deal with retail banks, though in practice many banks service both clients. In 2005 the nation&#x2019;s largest bank was New York&#x2013;based Citigroup Inc., which provides both commercial and retail banking services and which had total assets of nearly $1.5 trillion. Seattle-based Washington Mutual Inc. was the largest thrift, a consumer operation, with $308 billion in assets, three times larger than its nearest competitor. <br><br>Retail banks exist to provide an assortment of products that represent some of the first and most basic personal finance tools for consumers. In the past, savers could stop by just about any local bank and sign up for services that weren&#x2019;t terribly different from the bank down the street. Today, the savviest consumers shop around&#x2014;both locally and online&#x2014;since all banks offer different rates and fees for the various savings, lending and credit products they offer. Not every bank peddles the same line-up of products, while others, though they might feature some particular service, aren&#x2019;t trying to make a big business in that arena and, thus, price the service so that it&#x2019;s not particularly attractive to most consumers. <br><br>Savings Accounts <br><br>Think back on childhood: A savings account, aside from a piggy bank, was likely your first encounter with real personal finance, and it probably came with a little passbook in which the bank teller recorded your meager deposits. Mom and Dad, maybe your grandparents, opened a savings account for you and stuck a few dollars in there, probably taking the opportunity to tell you about compounding interest, which, at that age, likely generated about as much excitement as Brussels sprouts. <br><br>Savings accounts are the most basic banking accounts&#x2014;a place to park your cash and draw interest. Minimum account balances are typically low, sometimes just $5, and the interest rate is equally low, often the lowest among all savings products. But the accounts are FDIC insured and, therefore, &#x201c;safe&#x201d;&#x2014;meaning the full faith and credit of the United States government protects your account against the loss of even a single penny, up to the federal limit of $100,000. <br><br>Savings accounts, in their various forms, are where you want to park money if you expect to need it relatively soon&#x2014;like when buying a house&#x2014;or when you cannot afford to risk losing any of the cash. <br><br>Aside from the basic passbook account&#x2014;yes, old-fashioned as they are they still exist at some banks&#x2014;other types of savings accounts include certificates of deposit and money-market accounts; more on both of these in a moment. Typically, the best interest rates are found online by searching Web sites such as www.bankrate.com. <br><br>MONEY MARKET ACCOUNTS <br><br>Think of these as savings accounts on mild steroids. Your money is invested in what is literally known as the &#x201c;money market&#x201d;&#x2014;a vast market of ultra-short-term, highly rated debt obligations issued by various government agencies, corporations, and financial institutions that trade among large institutional investors in very large quantities. Basically, these are IOUs that come due usually within a year, and often within a few weeks or a few months. Because these pieces of paper are highly rated by various credit-rating agencies, such as Standard &amp; Poor&#x2019;s and Moody&#x2019;s Investors Service, the debt is considered safe, meaning there is a negligible risk that the bonds will not be repaid. <br><br>Money-market accounts are FDIC protected and pay slightly higher interest rates than standard savings accounts, but the rate is still relatively low. Minimum balances, however, are often relatively high&#x2014;$2,500 or more. And if the monthly balance slips below that, you&#x2019;ll typically pay a service charge&#x2014;usually around $10 or so&#x2014;for every month the account stays below the minimum. <br><br>Again, some of the best rates are found online rather than at your local bank. A good resource is www.banx.com. You&#x2019;ll have to register, but it&#x2019;s free, and you&#x2019;ll gain access to a broad listing of banks offering the best rates. <br><br>But a warning: While you can deposit money into these accounts as often as you like, withdrawals are usually limited to no more than three to six per month. And because many money-market accounts come with check-writing privileges, a trait not usually associated with a savings product, it&#x2019;s easy to just start writing checks on this account when you need the cash. Banks will cut you some slack the first time you exceed the limit, but beyond that they&#x2019;ll start imposing fees for each transaction over the limit. And if the breaches are persistent, a bank can unilaterally close your account, cutting you a check for whatever balance you have minus any fees the bank might impose. First, though, they&#x2019;ll often send a warning letter. A better approach is to withdraw the money in person or go online and transfer the cash from your money-market account to your savings; those types of withdrawals usually don&#x2019;t count toward the monthly maximum. <br><br>Don&#x2019;t confuse money-market accounts with money-market mutual funds. Though related, these two are very different, but more on that later in the Investing section. <br><br>CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT <br><br>CDs, as certificates of deposit are commonly called, are time deposits. That is, you deposit your money with a bank and promise not to touch the cash for a certain period of time. In return for that promise, the bank gives you what are usually the best interest rates it offers on savings products. Banks do this because they know you won&#x2019;t demand this money for several months to several years, which gives them a chance to lend the money and earn a bit of profit on your deposit. <br><br>CDs generally span uniform periods of time: three months, six months, nine months, one year, two years, and five years. In practice, there are a variety of other contract periods as well, such as 21D2 years, three years, seven years, and ten, among others. When the period ends, a CD is said to have &#x201c;matured.&#x201d; <br><br>Three-month CDs carry the lowest rates, often only marginally better than a money-market account. That&#x2019;s because the bank doesn&#x2019;t have a lot of time to make money off your deposit and must invest it only for the short term. Five-year CDs provide far better rates, usually several percentage points higher than savings accounts, because banks have a much longer period to earn money from your cash. <br><br>But don&#x2019;t dive into longer term CDs just to chase a high interest rate. CDs generally impose early withdrawal penalties if you reclaim your money before the contract&#x2019;s stated time period expires. The penalties vary, but you typically lose a meaningful amount of interest that has already accrued in your account. So carefully evaluate your near-term cash needs before opting to lock up your money for a long period. Long-term CDs can be a fine way to boost the overall return on your money, but not if you ultimately think there is a chance you might need to break the contract before the CD matures. <br><br>One caveat: In some situations, investing in a longer term CD instead of a short-term contract can be a savvy choice even if you break the CD before it matures. The long-term rate may be high enough and the penalty small enough that the overall interest you receive exceeds what you otherwise would have earned in the shorter-term certificate. Banks aren&#x2019;t going to advertise that, so it&#x2019;s up to you to do the math. [ . page 000] <br><br>CHECKING ACCOUNTS <br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t be out of money. I still have checks.&#x201d; That has been a popular bumper sticker for years, and it points to the ubiquity of checking accounts, the cornerstone of personal finance whether it&#x2019;s your own individual checking account or a joint account with a spouse, a partner, or even a parent. <br><br>Checking accounts are known as demand-deposit accounts because account holders&#x2014;those who own a checkbook&#x2014;can write a check that gives the person you paid the right to &#x201c;demand&#x201d; money from your account upon presenting that check to your bank. In the early days of check-writing, that is exactly what folks did; they&#x2019;d show up at a particular bank in town with a chit signed by a customer of that bank and demand cash in return. <br><br>Of course, these days the pizza parlor owner to whom you wrote a check for $19.36 for a large thin-crust with pepperoni and pineapple doesn&#x2019;t need to appear physically at your bank to claim the money. The owner just deposits your check at her own bank, and dozens more like it, all drawn on different banks&#x2014;some local, some out of town&#x2014;and all the money she&#x2019;s due ends up in her account within days. This happens because checks carry a variety of oddly rectilinear numbers along the bottom that serve as a bread crumb trail of sorts to help each check find its way home through the national banking system. <br><br>The nine digits farthest to the left are the ABA routing numbers that specify which branch of what particular banking company this check is drawn on. The sequence of numbers farthest to the right is the account number, signifying whose account at that branch is to be debited. <br><br>Regular checking accounts generally pay no interest. Checking accounts known as negotiable order of withdrawal accounts, or NOW accounts, often do pay interest. But NOW accounts frequently, though not always, require higher minimum balances or charge higher fees than a regular checking account. Some of the best rates and lowest fees on checking accounts are found at credit unions; because they are owned by the members and are nonprofit, credit unions are not consumed with generating fat profits like other banks are. <br><br>Whether you bank at a savings and loan, a building society, or a credit union, you&#x2019;ll need to balance your checkbook occasionally&#x2014;a chore so wretched for many people that they just estimate what they have and then hope for the best. That is an unhealthy approach to your money. You risk being overdrawn, for which the bank will impose a charge of about $25 (roughly the national average for a bounced-check fee), an unnecessary drain on your finances. Or you may risk not knowing you have more money than you realize, leaving you feeling needlessly strapped financially. <br><br>A laissez-faire approach to your most basic financial account can also lead to much larger problems with spending and debt since lackadaisical record keeping reflects poor financial management habits. If you can begin to track your checkbook accurately, you&#x2019;ll gain a better grasp on your spending since you&#x2019;ll be more aware of how the debit-card purchases, ATM transactions, and checks you write are really impacting your finances. If nothing else, balance your checkbook to save money. Banks, like humans, aren&#x2019;t infallible; they make mistakes, too, and you want to catch those mistakes in the event they erroneously reduce your account balance. <br><br>Of course, if you just can&#x2019;t muster the effort, invest in an inexpensive computerized money-management program such as Microsoft Money or Intuit Quicken. With minimal effort on your part, it will keep the debits and credits in your checking account in a healthy balance. [ . page 000] <br><br>ATM CARDS <br><br>Automated Teller Machines revolutionized banking by allowing customers to interact with their checking and savings accounts absent a bank teller. Stick your plastic magnetized card in the machine, punch in a personal identification number, or PIN, and out comes a wad of cash. As recently as the late 1990s some residents in remote parts of Alaska refused to deal with ATMs, considering them devil machines because they couldn&#x2019;t understand how or why it would dispense money. <br><br>Banks love ATMs because they dramatically cut demand on tellers, thereby saving money. And by charging non-bank customers a fee of between $1 and $4 per transaction to use the machine, ATMs generate lots of noninterest income. That surcharge might seem a small price for convenience, but hit an ATM not affiliated with your bank once a week for a year, and you&#x2019;ve spent as much as $200 just to access your own money&#x2014;and that doesn&#x2019;t count the $1 or more your own bank will levy each time you venture outside your bank&#x2019;s own ATM network. <br><br>Thus, if you&#x2019;re a frequent ATM user, it is best to look for a bank with lots of convenient ATM locations, including those inside nearby supermarkets, where banks are increasingly locating mini-branches. Banks typically list ATM and branch locations on their Web sites. Also, check for banks that have surcharge-free ATM machines. <br><br>If you can&#x2019;t find an ATM for your bank, then use a competing bank because the fee is usually lower than you&#x2019;ll find at independently owned machines inside gas stations, hotels, casinos, and convenience stores. <br><br>By the way, the blandly named Electronic Fund Transfer Act limits your loss to $50 if your ATM card is stolen and cash is ultimately siphoned from your account. But you must report the card lost within two days of noticing its disappearance. Wait longer and your liability rises significantly. <br><br>DEBIT CARDS <br><br>Don&#x2019;t feel like searching out an ATM or don&#x2019;t want to pay the fee to use one outside your bank&#x2019;s network? That&#x2019;s where debit cards come in. They look identical to credit cards (and some serve that function as well), but they act more like ATM cards (and some serve that function, too). Instead of taking on debt as you would when buying the week&#x2019;s groceries with a credit card, you are instead, with the swipe of your card through the electronic reader, authorizing the grocer to directly withdraw funds from your bank account, usually a checking account. <br><br>This is an immediate transfer, exactly as though you pulled the money from your account at the ATM. That means you cannot float a purchase until the credit-card bill arrives. If you don&#x2019;t have enough money in your account, your transaction won&#x2019;t go through. <br><br>Debit cards are increasingly popular among consumers and retailers since the cards act like electronic cash. For the consumer there is no need to carry money or checks, yet you don&#x2019;t accumulate interest charges as you do when paying for purchases with a credit card. That allows for better financial management because you see immediately the effect that even a single small purchase has on your checkbook balance and your monthly spending and savings goals. With a credit card the effect of all but the largest, most memorable purchases are lost in the fog of all the random spending you do each month. And because most debit cards are accepted globally&#x2014;generally anywhere major credit cards are taken&#x2014;you don&#x2019;t need to pack nearly as many traveler&#x2019;s checks or as much cash as you ordinarily would.</p><h2>Algebra 2 for Christian Schools, Teacher&#39;s Edition</h2><p>&#34;Review basic algebraic functions and extend your student&#39;s skills in graphing and in solving equations.

In it, the widowed American Adam Verver is in Europe with his daughter Maggie. They are rich, finely appreciative of European art and culture, and deeply attached to each other. Maggie has all the innocent charm of so many of Jamess young American heroines. She is engaged to Amerigo, an impoverished Italian prince; he must marry money, and as his name suggests, an American heiress is the perfect solution. The golden bowl, first seen in a London curio shop, is used emblematically throughout the novel. Not solid gold but gilded crystal, the perfect surface conceals a flaw; it is symbolic of the relationship between the main characters and of the world in which they move. <br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong> For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.<br>Also in Europe is an old friend of Maggies, Charlotte Stant, a girl of great charm and independence, and Maggie is blindly ignorant of the fact that she and the prince are lovers. Maggie and Amerigo are married and have a son, but Maggie remains dependent for real intimacy on her father, and she and Amerigo grow increasingly apart. Feeling that her father has suffered a loss through her marriage, Maggie decides to find him a wife, and her choice falls on Charlotte. Charlottes affair with the prince continues and Adam Verver seems to her to be a suitable and convenient match. When Maggie herself finally comes into possession of the golden bowl, the flaw is revealed to her, and, inadvertently, the truth about Amerigo and Charlotte. Fanny Assingham (an older woman, aware of the truth from the beginning) deliberately breaks the bowl, and this marks the end of Maggies innocence. She is no pathetic heroine-victim, however. Abstaining from outcry and outrage she instead takes the reins and maneuvers people and events. She still wants to be with Amerigo, but he must continue to be worth having and they must all be saved further humiliations and indignities. To be a wife she must cease to be a daughter; Adam Verver and the unhappy Charlotte are banished forever to America, and the new Maggie will establish a real marriage with Amerigo.<br></p><p>Henry James (1843-1916), son of Henry James Sr. and brother of the philosopher and psychologist William James and diarist Alice James, was an American-born author and literary critic of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

While working as a marriage counselor for more than 30 years, he identified five love languages: Words of Affirmation, Quality Time, Receiving Gifts, Acts of Service, and Physical Touch. In a friendly, often humorous style, he unpacks each one. Some husbands or wives may crave focused attention; another needs regular praise. Gifts are highly important to one spouse, while another sees fixing a leaky faucet, ironing a shirt, or cooking a meal as filling their "love tank." Some partners might find physical touch makes them feel valued: holding hands, giving back rubs, and sexual contact. Chapman illustrates each love language with real-life examples from his counseling practice. <p> How do you discover your spouse&#x2019;s &#x2013; and your own &#x2013; love language? Chapman&#x2019;s short questionnaires are one of several ways to find out. Throughout the book, he also includes application questions that can be answered more extensively in the beautifully detailed companion leather journal (an exclusive Amazon.com set).

But they are young. All life still lies ahead. Vesey heads off hopefully to pursue a career as an actor. Harriet marries and has a child, becoming a settled member of suburban society. And then Vesey returns, the worse for wear, and with him the love whose memory they have both sentimentally cherished, and even after so much has happened it cannot be denied. But things are not at all as they used to be. Love, it seems, is hardly designed to survive life.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the finest twentieth-century English novelists, Elizabeth Taylor, like her contemporaries Graham Greene, Richard Yates, and Michelangelo Antonioni, was a connoisseur of the modern world&#x2019;s forsaken zones. Her characters are real, people caught out by their own desires and decisions, and they demand our attention. The be-stilled suburban backwaters she sets out to explore shimmer in her books with the punishing clarity of a desert mirage.</p><p>ELIZABETH TAYLOR (1912&#x2013;1975) was born into a middle-class family in Berkshire, England. She held a variety of positions, including librarian and governess, before marrying a businessman in 1936. Nine years later, her first novel, <i>At Mrs. Lippincote&#x2019;s</i>, appeared. She would go on to publish<br>eleven more novels, including <i>Angel</i> (available as an NYRB Classic), four collections of short stories (many of which originally appeared in <i>The New Yorker, Harper&#x2019;s</i>, and other magazines), and a children&#x2019;s book, <i>Mossy Trotter</i>, while living with her husband and two children in Buckinghamshire. Long championed by Ivy Compton-Burnett, Barbara Pym, Robert Liddell, Kingsley Amis, and Elizabeth Jane Howard, Taylor&#x2019;s novels and stories have been the basis for a number of films, including <i>Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont</i> (2005), starring Joan Plowright, and Fran�ois Ozon&#x2019;s <i>Angel </i>(2007). In 2013 NYRB Classics will publish a new selection of Taylor&#x2019;s short stories.<br><br>CALEB CRAIN is the author of <i>American Sympathy</i>, a study of friendship between men in early American literature. He has written for<i> The New Yorker, The New York Review of Books</i>, and <i>n+1</i>. His novel <i>Necessary Errors</i> will be published in 2013.&#x201c;Taylor has the genius of making her characters understood, sometimes with an almost frightening clarity, perhaps because she is compassionate as well as relentless in her delineation of them.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;<i>The New York Times</i><br><br>&#x201c;Funny, savage and full of loneliness and suppressed emotion.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Rachel Cooke, <i>The Observer</i><br><br>&#x201c;It is time that justice was done to Elizabeth Taylor. . . . All her writings could be described as coming into the category of comedy. Comedy is the best vehicle for truths that are too fierce to be borne.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Anita Brookner<br><br>&#x201c;Elizabeth Taylor is finally being recognized as an important British author: an author of great subtlety, great compassion and great depth. As a reader, I have found huge pleasure in returning to Taylor&#x2019;s novels and short stories many times over. As a writer I&#x2019;ve returned to her too&#x2014;in awe of her achievements, and trying to work out how she does it.&#x201d; &#x2014;Sarah Waters</p><h2>Humanity: An Introduction to Cultural Anthropology</h2><p>Using engaging stories and clear writing, HUMANITY: AN INTRODUCTION TO CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY, Tenth Edition, introduces cultural anthropology within a solid framework centered on globalization and culture change. Peoples and Bailey focus on the social and cultural consequences of globalization, emphasizing culture change and world problems. The book&#39;s engaging narrative provides new ways of looking at many of the challenges facing the world in this century. As you explore contemporary issues including recent debates on gay marriage, cultural and economic globalization, population growth, hunger, and the survival of indigenous cultures, you will gain a better understanding of the cultural information you need to successfully navigate in today&#39;s global economy. The authors emphasize the diversity of humanity and reveal why an appreciation and tolerance of cultural differences is critical in the modern world.</p><p>James Peoples is professor of Sociology/Anthropology and Director of East Asian Studies at Ohio Wesleyan University, where he has been teaching courses in anthropology since 1988.

First translated into English by Pearl S. Buck in 1933 as <i>All Men Are Brothers</i>, the original edition of the J.H. Jackson translation appeared under the title <i>The Water Margin</i> in 1937. In this updated edition, Edwin Lowe addresses many of the shortcomings found in the original J.H. Jackson translation, and replaces the original grit and flavor of <i>Shuihui Zhuan</i> found in Chinese versions, including the sexual seduction, explicit descriptions of brutality and barbarity, and the profane voices of the thieving, scheming, drinking, fighting, pimping lower classes of Song Dynasty China. Similarly, the Chinese deities, Bodhisattvas, gods and demons have reclaimed their true names, as has the lecherous, over-sexed and ill-fated Ximen Qing. All of which was sanitized out when first published in 1937.<br><br> While Chinese in origin, the themes of <i>The Water Margin</i> are universal enough that it has served as a source of inspiration for numerous movies, television shows and video games up to the present day.</p><p><b>Shi Naian</b> is one of the respected elders of Chinese literature. In addition to authoring Water Margin, he was also the teacher of Lo Kuan-chung, author of Romance of the Three Kingdoms. <br><br><b>J. H.

His translation of The Water Margin was the first to follow the text of the Chinese original closely. It was his only translated work. <br><br><b>Edwin Lowe</b> is Associate Lecturer of Chinese Studies in the Department of Asian Studies at Macquarie University, Sydney.

Lott&#x2019;s <i>More Guns, Less Crime</i> drew both lavish praise and heated criticism. More than a decade later, it continues to play a key role in ongoing arguments over gun-control laws: despite all the attacks by gun-control advocates, no one has ever been able to refute Lott&#x2019;s simple, startling conclusion that more guns mean less crime. Relying on the most rigorously comprehensive data analysis ever conducted on crime statistics and right-to-carry laws, the book directly challenges common perceptions about the relationship of guns, crime, and violence. For this third edition, Lott draws on an additional ten years of data&#x2014;including provocative analysis of the effects of gun bans in Chicago and Washington, D.C&#x2014;that brings the book fully up to date and further bolsters its central contention.</p></p><p><p><b>John R.

By providing strong empirical evidence that yet another liberal policy is a cause of the very evil it purports to cure, he has permanently changed the terms of debate on gun control. . . .

Rather, it&#x2019;s making the most of our fantasies by brushing them up against the very thing most of us are taught to ignore or diminish: the obstacles that stand in our way.&#x201d;<br><br>So often in our day-to-day lives we&#x2019;re inundated with advice to &#x201c;think positively.&#x201d; From pop music to political speeches to commercials, the general message is the same: look on the bright side, be optimistic in the face of adversity, and focus on your dreams. And whether we&#x2019;re trying to motivate ourselves to lose weight, snag a promotion at work, or run a marathon, we&#x2019;re told time and time again that focusing on fulfilling our wishes will make them come true.<br><br>Gabriele Oettingen draws on more than twenty years of research in the science of human motivation to reveal why the conventional wisdom falls short. The obstacles that we think prevent us from realizing our deepest wishes can actually lead to their fulfillment. Starry-eyed dreaming isn&#x2019;t all it&#x2019;s cracked up to be, and as it turns out, dreamers are not often doers.<br><br>While optimism can help us alleviate immediate suffering and persevere in challenging times, merely dreaming about the future actually makes people more frustrated and unhappy over the long term and less likely to achieve their goals. In fact, the pleasure we gain from positive fantasies allows us to fulfill our wishes virtually, sapping our energy to perform the hard work of meeting challenges and achieving goals in real life.<br><br>Based on her groundbreaking research and large-scale scientific studies, Oettingen introduces a new way to visualize the future, calledmental contrasting. It combines focusing on our dreams with visualizing the obstacles that stand in our way. By experiencing our dreams in our minds and facing reality we can address our fears, make concrete plans, and gain energy to take action.<br><br>In&nbsp;Rethinking Positive Thinking, Oettingen applies mental contrasting to three key areas of personal change&#x2014; becoming healthier, nurturing personal and professional relationships, and performing better at work. She introduces readers to the key phases of mental contrasting using a proven four-step process called WOOP&#x2014;Wish, Outcome, Obstacle, Plan&#x2014;and offers advice and exercises on how to best apply this method to daily life. Through mental contrasting, people in Oettingen&#x2019;s studies have become significantly more motivated to quit smoking, lose weight, get better grades, sustain fulfilling relationships, and negotiate more effectively in business situations.<br><br>Whether you are unhappy and struggling with serious problems or you just want to improve, discover, and explore new opportunities, this book will deepen your ideas about human motivation and help you boldly chart a new path ahead.</p><p>Gabriele Oettingen&nbsp;is a professor of psychology at New York University and the University of Hamburg and the author of more than a hundred articles and book chapters on the effects of future thought on cognition, emotion, and behavior. She lives in New York City and in Hamburg, Germany.<p></p><p></p><p>Author&#x2019;s Note</p><p>Throughout the book, I draw from the scientific articles and book chapters my colleagues and I have published over the past twenty years. In describing our experiments, our findings, and their implications, I have cited the articles used in the writing of this book so that readers can consult the original texts if they wish. I am deeply cognizant of the rich intellectual contributions of my coauthors, my fellow travelers in the rethinking of positive thinking.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Preface</p><p>What is your dearest wish? What dreams do you have for the future? What do you want to be or do? Imagine your dream coming true. How wonderful it would be. How fulfilling.</p><p>What holds you back from realizing your wish? What is it in <i>you</i> that stops you from really going for it?</p><p><i>Rethinking Positive Thinking </i>is a book about wishes and how to fulfill them. It draws on twenty years of research in the science of motivation. And it presents a single, surprising idea: the obstacles that we think most impede us from realizing our deepest wishes can actually hasten their fulfillment.</p><p>Approached by someone who wants to achieve a specific dream, many of us offer simple advice: think positive! Don&#x2019;t dwell on the obstacles, since that will only bring you down; be optimistic, focus on what you want to achieve; imagine a happy future in which you&#x2019;re active and engaged; visualize how much snazzier you&#x2019;ll look when you&#x2019;ve lost that twenty pounds, how much happier you&#x2019;ll feel when you&#x2019;ve snagged that promotion, how much more attractive your partner will find you when you&#x2019;ve quit drinking, how much more successful you&#x2019;ll be when you&#x2019;ve started that new business. Channel positive energy and before you know it, all your wishes and goals will come true.</p><p>Yet dreamers are not often doers. My research has confirmed that merely dreaming about the future makes people <i>less</i> likely to realize their dreams and wishes (as does dwelling on the obstacles in their path). There are multiple reasons why dreaming detached from an awareness of reality doesn&#x2019;t cut it. The pleasurable act of dreaming seems to let us fulfill our wishes in our minds, sapping our energy to perform the hard work of meeting the challenges in real life.</p><p>Another way to visualize our future exists, a more complex approach that emerges out of work I&#x2019;ve done in the scientific study of human motivation. I call this method &#x201c;mental contrasting,&#x201d; and it instructs us to dream our dreams but then visualize the personal barriers or impediments that prevent us from achieving these dreams. Perhaps we fear that by bringing our dreams directly up against reality, we&#x2019;ll quash our aspirations&#x2014;that we&#x2019;ll wind up even more lethargic, unmotivated, and stuck. But that&#x2019;s not what happens. When we perform mental contrasting, we <i>gain</i> energy to take action. And when we go on to specify the actions we intend to take as obstacles arise, we energize ourselves even further.</p><p>In my studies, people who have applied mental contrasting have become significantly more motivated to quit cigarettes, lose weight, get better grades, sustain healthier relationships, negotiate more effectively in business situations&#x2014;you name it. Simply put, by adding a bit of realism to people&#x2019;s positive imaginings of the future, mental contrasting enables them to become dreamers <i>and</i> doers.</p><p><i>Rethinking Positive Thinking </i>presents scientific research suggesting that starry-eyed dreaming isn&#x2019;t all it&#x2019;s cracked up to be. The book then examines and documents the power of a deceptively simple task: juxtaposing our dreams with the obstacles that prevent their attainment. I delve into why such mental contrasting works, particularly on the level of our subconscious minds, and introduce the specific planning process that renders it even more effective. In the book&#x2019;s last two chapters, I apply the method of mental contrasting to three areas of personal change&#x2014;becoming healthier, nurturing better relationships, and performing better at school and work&#x2014;and I offer advice on how to get started with this method in your own life. In particular, I present a four-step procedure based on mental contrasting called WOOP&#x2014;Wish, Outcome, Obstacle, Plan&#x2014;that is easy to learn, easy to apply to short- and long-term wishes, and that is scientifically shown to help you become more energized and directed.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve written <i>Rethinking Positive Thinking </i>for individuals who are stuck and don&#x2019;t know what to do about it. It&#x2019;s also for people whose lives are just fine but who might wonder if they could be better. It&#x2019;s for people who have a particular challenge in front of them that they&#x2019;ve tried and failed to handle in the past or that they just don&#x2019;t know how to approach. Ultimately, though, I&#x2019;ve written it for all of us. We all need help motivating ourselves so that we can stay on track and move ahead.</p><p>Why is this? Well, traditional societies have more mechanisms in place&#x2014;rituals, habits, rules, laws, norms&#x2014;that circumscribe individual autonomy and assign people roles and responsibilities. The same is true in repressive societies such as North Korea or the former East Germany. When we lack freedom of action, our own choices do not matter so much because external forces push and pull us to act or prevent us from doing so. The challenge people face in these societies primarily involves keeping up their morale and persevering.</p><p>Modern Western societies are different, confronting us with what some call the &#x201c;curse of freedom.&#x201d; The pull and push of tradition and external authority seems to have subsided. Many of us experience more freedom than ever, but we are now required to act on our own&#x2014;to find it <i>in us</i> to stay motivated, energized, engaged, and connected. Nobody is guiding us, day after day, to do what it takes to stay healthy, to pursue a fulfilling career, or to build a family. Nobody is standing over us giving meaning to our lives. It&#x2019;s all on our shoulders. We need to keep ourselves on track&#x2014;and we need to restore our ability to take constructive action when we get painfully stuck.</p><p>Indulging in fantasies about the future doesn&#x2019;t help. Though enjoyable in the short term, fantasies only deplete our efforts and lead us to stumble over and over again. We wind up mired in indecision, on the verge of apathy, prone to an impulsive lurching from action to action, pushed beyond our capabilities, seething with frustration, and falling into an unhappiness we don&#x2019;t understand. But by experiencing our dreams in our minds <i>and also </i>grounding ourselves in the realities we are bound to encounter, we can charge ourselves up to tackle life head-on&#x2014;to connect with what is most real and abiding in our lives.</p><p>Whether you are unhappy and struggling with serious problems, or just want to discover, explore, and optimize hidden possibilities and opportunities, this book will deepen your ideas about human motivation and help you boldly chart a path ahead. Like so many participants in my studies, you&#x2019;ll come away more motivated than ever to connect with others, engage with the world around you, and take action. All from a single, counterintuitive question: What holds you back from realizing your dreams?</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter One</p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p><p>Dreaming, Not Doing</p><p>One of my friends, a man in his early forties whom I&#x2019;ll call Ben, remembers having an intense but rather corny crush on a fellow student when he attended college during the late 1980s. He had seen this woman on several occasions while dining with his friends at a cafeteria on campus. As Ben would shave in the morning or try to pay attention during lectures, his mind would drift and he would picture what it would be like to be in a relationship with this woman. He imagined that she was an artist, and that the two of them would tour architectural ruins in Rome and gaze up at the Sistine Chapel. Maybe she would want to sketch him lying on the quad on a sunny day reading a book, or, better yet, playing jazz piano, as he often did on weekends to earn extra money. Wouldn&#x2019;t it be wonderful to share peaceful moments with someone capable of understanding and sharing his own creativity? For that matter, wouldn&#x2019;t it be wonderful to have a woman to go to the movies with, or to watch a sunset with, or to hop a bus and go to a nearby city with?</p><p>Ben didn&#x2019;t tell his friends about his daydreams; he thought of them as his little secret. They were wonderfully satisfying images, but unfortunately, they stayed just that. You see, Ben couldn&#x2019;t bring himself to ask this woman out. He told himself she was a total stranger and he&#x2019;d make a fool of himself by flirting with her. Besides, he was too busy with schoolwork to date someone. He wanted to get good grades, and it wasn&#x2019;t as if he lacked friends to hang out with on the weekends.</p><p>Why didn&#x2019;t Ben have the energy and drive to step up and make his move? He was doing what so many of us regard as essential to success&#x2014;dreaming about fulfilling our wishes. What was holding him back?</p><p>The Cult of Optimism</p><p>The notion that simply imagining our deepest wishes coming true will help us attain them is everywhere these days. Best-selling books like <i>The Secret</i>1<i> </i>and <i>Chicken Soup for the Soul</i>2<i> </i>teach us that we can make good things happen just by thinking positively, and that positive thinkers are &#x201c;healthier, more active, more productive&#x2014;and held in higher regard by those around them.&#x201d;3 So many of us do think positively, as illustrated by the unvarnished, smiling optimism of contestants on <i>American Idol</i>, who speak confidently of their talents and their dream of being discovered, or their counterparts on the <i>Bachelor</i>, many of whom express absolute certainty that they will outshine all the other girls and win the big prize. These individuals gain popularity among audiences not only for having elaborate fantasies about future success, but for living in the bubble of these fantasies and assuming without a sliver of doubt that one day their daydreams will come true.</p><p>The cult of optimism goes further than that. Advertising puts forth happy, optimistic people as paragons of success. Politicians at all levels regale the citizenry by claiming the mantle of hope and touting the virtues of the &#x201c;American dream.&#x201d; Economists chart &#x201c;consumer confidence&#x201d; and survey business leaders about how optimistic their outlook is for the future; financial markets rise and fall on such data. Popular music celebrates the ability of dreaming and dreamers to save the world. We&#x2019;re also warned from a young age and at every subsequent turn to rid ourselves of harmful &#x201c;negative self-talk&#x201d; or to &#x201c;get out of the hole of negative thinking&#x201d; if we want to succeed in life.4 An inspiring message posted on the wall of a Manhattan middle school exhorts kids to &#x201c;Reach for the moon; even if you miss, you&#x2019;ll land among the stars.&#x201d;</p><p>Optimism appears to prevail even in the face of extreme adversity. In 2008, amidst a severe recession, PepsiCo began surveying American consumers as part of its Pepsi Optimism Project. In 2010, a full 94 percent of those surveyed felt that &#x201c;optimism is important in creating new ideas that can have a positive impact on the world.&#x201d; Almost three-quarters of participants reported that they &#x201c;expect the best to happen in uncertain times.&#x201d; And over 90 percent said that they &#x201c;believe that optimism can have a strong impact on moving society forward in a positive direction.&#x201d;5 By 2013, some observers were decrying the death of the American dream and American optimism, yet a survey that year sponsored by the Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company found that 73 percent of Americans saw life as &#x201c;the glass half full&#x201d; and 79 percent felt that the American dream was still alive.6 Another poll by Gallup found that 69 percent of those surveyed were &#x201c;optimistic&#x201d; about their personal prospects in 2013.7</p><p>The worship of optimism is not of recent vintage, nor is it uniquely American. It&#x2019;s a theme in world literature, from Marcus Aurelius (&#x201c;Dwell on the beauty of life&#x201d;)8 to Samuel Johnson (&#x201c;that the habit of looking on the best side of everything is worth a thousand a-year&#x201d;)9 to Dr. Seuss (&#x201c;And when things start to happen, don&#x2019;t worry, don&#x2019;t stew. Just go right along, you&#x2019;ll start happening too&#x201d;).10 But Americans traditionally have seemed to relish their optimistic outlook. &#x201c;Pessimism never won any battle,&#x201d; President Dwight Eisenhower once said. Charlie Chaplin likewise came out on the side of positive thinking, stating that &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll never find rainbows if you&#x2019;re looking down.&#x201d;11</p><p>Belief in the power of optimism rests on a simple idea: by looking at the future, we can hang tough and do our best in the present. And if we are going to look ahead, thinking positively seems to be the way to go. What else are we going to do&#x2014;dwell on how doomed we are to misfortune and misery? How motivating is that? A common adage circulating on the Web (and printed on T-shirts) says it all: &#x201c;Dream it. Wish it. Do it.&#x201d;</p><p>Given optimism&#x2019;s prevalence, it sometimes feels risky to express even mildly negative viewpoints inside institutions and organizations. If you&#x2019;re in the workplace and you take the position of the &#x201c;realist,&#x201d; others will often label you a &#x201c;Debby downer&#x201d; or a killjoy. Filmmakers and television producers often shrink from offering tragic themes and sad endings, fearing that they will come across as &#x201c;too dark&#x201d; and turn viewers off. For that matter, what politician wants to question the merit of an optimistic outlook or be seen as breaking from the traditional &#x201c;can-do&#x201d; attitude?</p><p>As a German citizen who came to the United States relatively late in life, I was initially struck by how much more positive thinking was valued in the United States than back in Europe. In Germany, if you asked how someone was doing, you would usually get a frank answer, such as &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t sleep well last night,&#x201d; or &#x201c;My puppy got sick and it&#x2019;s bothering me.&#x201d; In America, I noticed how people would say, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine&#x201d;&#x2014;even if something was bothering them. I also noticed that people found it jarring when someone violated the unwritten rule of positivity. In 1986, when I was a postdoctoral fellow in Philadelphia, a professor told me about a faculty meeting during which she described some difficult things happening in her life. Her colleagues became highly critical of her for being so &#x201c;negative&#x201d; in a professional setting. It was implied that she needed to learn to keep her negativity to herself, so that it wouldn&#x2019;t infect other people.</p><p>A Closer Look at Optimism</p><p>As unfamiliar as this widespread optimism was to me, I felt thankful for it and did not see it as a counterproductive presence in society. I felt people were being considerate and not dumping all their problems on one another. They valued being in a good mood and keeping others in a good mood as well. I gained a more nuanced perspective, though, when I began to study optimism during the mid-1980s. Initially, I was inspired by what I had seen in East Germany during the Cold War. I researched cross-cultural differences in levels of depressive behavior and compared pessimistic outlooks between individuals living under communism in East Germany with those who lived in West Germany&#x2019;s more open, democratic society.12 As part of this research, I went into bars (or &lt;...</p></p><h2>A Theology for Christian Education</h2><p>What is &#x201c;Christian&#x201d; about Christian education; how is it different from on-Christian education? <i>A Theology for Christian Education </i>examines this question in depth and argues that the doctrines of systematic theology should drive the content, purpose, and methods of the educational program of the c hurch.

His endless curiosity and passion for detail resulted in a wealth of notebooks, diaries, correspondence, and published writings that Peter S�s transforms into a visual treasure trove. A multilayered journey through Darwin's world, <i>The Tree of Life </i>begins with his childhood and traces the arc of his life through university and career, following him around the globe on the voyage of the Beagle, and home to a quiet but momentous life devoted to science and family. S�s uses his own singular vision to create a gloriously detailed panorama of a genius's trajectory through investigating and understanding the mysteries of nature. In pictures executed in fine pen and ink and lush watercolors &#x2013; cameo portraits, illustrated pages of diary, cutaway views of the Beagle, as well as charts, maps, and a gatefold spread &#x2013; Peter S�s has shaped a wondrous introduction to Charles Darwin. This title has Common Core connections.</p><p><i>The Tree of Life</i> is a 2003 New York Times Book Review Best Illustrated Book of the Year and Notable Children's Book of the Year, and a 2004 Bank Street - Best Children's Book of the Year.</p></p><p>Here is a fascinating, detailed look at the life of Charles Darwin: naturalist, geologist, and independent thinker. In his author's note, Caldecott Honor illustrator Peter Sis (<i>Starry Messenger</i>, <i>Tibet: Through the Red Box</i>) writes that Darwin always regretted not learning how to draw. However, he could and did take "dense and vivid" written notes, from which Sis drew his inspiration. Readers will spend hours poring over the gorgeous, intricately crafted pen-and-ink and watercolor illustrations depicting layer upon layer of Darwin&#x2019;s life as he developed his theories about the origins of life and natural selection. Tidbits from Darwin&#x2019;s extensive and legendary voyage on the <i>Beagle</i>, notes on Galapagos tortoises, bloodsucking benchuca bugs, and Toxodon skeletons, and particulars from his family life intermingle with each other--just as in real life. Crammed with a veritable muddle of diary entries, cameo portraits, diagrams, natural illustrations, maps, timelines, a gatefold spread, and narrative divided into "Public Life," "Private Life," and "Secret Life" blocks of text, <i>The Tree of Life</i> will certainly be overwhelming to some readers; for other, less linear thinkers, it will be sheer, chaotic delight.

When it was first published in December 1949, it immediately became the standard guide to its subject, providing for the first time a comprehensive manual for the description of printed books as physical objects. In it, Bowers consolidated and expanded upon the achievements of an English tradition that was nearly a century old. His book was an act of creative synthesis, which established a new point of departure. Although there has been much activity in descriptive bibliography since then, the <i>Principles</i> still holds its place as the central book to which those engaged in bibliographical work must continually return. Bowers ended a 1948 article by referring to the satisfaction of producing a descriptive bibliography that "will stand up under the test of time and will never need to be done again"; it begins to appear that in his book about descriptive bibliography he may have achieved such a work. It is a landmark in the history of scholarship, to be sure, but it is also a work of vital contemporary relevance. --from the introduction by G.

Many of the best examples office buildings, movie theaters, hotels, and churches are still in use. Deco architects, artists, and designers drew on European styles but were most committed to a style that grew organically, as they saw it, from their native soil. Two themes bound Deco buildings and their decorative schemes together: a regional pride that tied buildings to their specific locales and functions, and a growing national symbolism that asserted the buildings' identity as uniquely, independently American. <em>American Art Deco</em> features description sand over 500 color photographs of seventy-five lavish and innovatively designed buildings across the country that have been preserved both outside and in, giving the full scope of this beloved, exciting style.</p><p><b>Carla Breeze</b> is a photographer and the author of, among other works,<i> New York Deco and L.A.

He was detained there briefly and released with a warning: &#x201c;You are not welcome in this country.&#x201d; The people who warned him were not Chileans but Germans, not government officials but agents of the assassination network Operation Condor. They were also Nazis, providing a sanctuary for men like Josef Mengele, Hans-Ulrich Rudel, and Otto Skorzeny. In other words: ODESSA.</p><p>Published in 1995, <i>Unholy Alliance</i> was the first book in English on the subject of Nazi occultism to be based on the captured Nazi archives themselves, as well as on the author&#x2019;s personal investigations and interviews, often conducted under dangerous conditions. The book attracted the attention of historians and journalists the world over and has been translated into six languages. A later edition boasts the famous foreword by Norman Mailer.</p><p>How did occultism come to play such an important role in the development of Nazi political ideology? What influence did such German and Austrian occult leaders as Lanz von Liebenfels and Guido von List have over the fledgling Nazi party? What was the Thule Gesellschaft, and who was its creator, Baron von Sebottendorf? Did the Nazi high command really believe in occultism? In astrology? In magic and reincarnation?</p><p>This is a new and expanded edition of the original text, with much additional information on the rise of extremist groups in Europe, Latin America, Asia, and the United States and the esoteric beliefs that are at their foundations. It is the first book in a trilogy that includes <i>Ratline</i> and <i>The Hitler Legacy</i>. This is where it all began.</p></p><p><b>Peter Levenda</b> is a well-known author of many published works on esoteric subjects. <i>Unholy Alliance</i> was nominated for a Bram Stoker award for nonfiction in 1995. <i>Ratline</i> and <i>The Hitler Legacy</i> round out this important trilogy of Nazi history.

Surely, theoretical physicists are immune to mere trends, dogmatic beliefs, or flights of fancy? In fact, acclaimed physicist and bestselling author Roger Penrose argues that researchers working at the extreme frontiers of physics are just as susceptible to these forces as anyone else. In this provocative book, he argues that fashion, faith, and fantasy, while sometimes productive and even essential in physics, may be leading today's researchers astray in three of the field's most important areas&#x2015;string theory, quantum mechanics, and cosmology.</p><p>Arguing that string theory has veered away from physical reality by positing six extra hidden dimensions, Penrose cautions that the fashionable nature of a theory can cloud our judgment of its plausibility. In the case of quantum mechanics, its stunning success in explaining the atomic universe has led to an uncritical faith that it must also apply to reasonably massive objects, and Penrose responds by suggesting possible changes in quantum theory. Turning to cosmology, he argues that most of the current fantastical ideas about the origins of the universe cannot be true, but that an even wilder reality may lie behind them. Finally, Penrose describes how fashion, faith, and fantasy have ironically also shaped his own work, from twistor theory, a possible alternative to string theory that is beginning to acquire a fashionable status, to "conformal cyclic cosmology," an idea so fantastic that it could be called "conformal crazy cosmology."</p><p>The result is an important critique of some of the most significant developments in physics today from one of its most eminent figures.</p></p><p><p>"This gem of a book is vintage Roger Penrose: eloquently argued and deeply original on every page. His perspective on the present crisis and future promise of physics and cosmology provides an important corrective to fashionable thinking at this crucial moment in science. This book deserves the widest possible hearing among specialists and the public alike."<b>--Lee Smolin, author of <i>Time Reborn: From the Crisis in Physics to the Future of the Universe</i></b></p><b>Roger Penrose</b>, one the world's foremost theoretical physicists, has won numerous prizes, including the Albert Einstein Medal, for his fundamental contributions to general relativity and cosmology. He is the bestselling author, with Stephen Hawking, of <i>The Nature of Space and Time</i> (Princeton). Penrose's other books include <i>Cycles of Time: An Extraordinary New View of the Universe</i> and <i>The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe</i> (both Vintage).

The plainspoken Callahan decided early that photography could be the medium for "some set of values that I am trying to discover and establish as being my life." He has never focused on public themes, however, but on familiar landscape and one particular woman, his wife, Eleanor. Inspired as a young man by the spectacular images of Ansel Adams, Callahan nevertheless did not require sublime landscape as material. His visual poetry has come more often from a few blades of grass or a barren city street. A pure photographer, concerned with what he calls "the standard photographic problems" --focus, contrast, selection, motion, and multiple exposure--Callahan has maintained remarkable consistency of vision as well as a most individual voice. This book, cataloging a major retrospective exhibition, is the broadest overview of the art and the man. Even collections with much Callahan material (there is no dearth--he is well documented) should add this summative, definitive volume. <i>Gretchen Garner</i></p><h2>Nikon D3400 For Dummies (For Dummies (Lifestyle))</h2><p><b>Discover the essentials to getting better photos with the Nikon DLSLR D3400</b> <p>The Nikon D3400 hits stores as Nikon's most advanced entry-level DSLR camera.

Using German sources, the author has investigated an important aspect of the pre-attack deception, the degree to which the German public and armed forces were themselves caught unawares.</p><p>Robert Kershaw is a serving colonel in the British Army, having joined the Parachute Regiment after graduating in History from Reading University in 1972. His previous work, &#34;It Never Snows in September&#34; is considered a classic and is now in its fifth printing.The author, a serving colonel in the British airborne, takes his title from the German expression "kein blumenkrieg" denoting the difference between the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 from the earlier easy conquests in the West. Unlike the relatively easy conquests in the West that were followed by parades with flowers, the early victories in Russia did not result in glorious parades. Kershaw weaves numerous German and Soviet diary and letter accounts in with cogent analysis to present a "soldier's account" of the massive German invasion of the USSR. It is important to note that this is not a comprehensive account of Operation Barbarossa. The contributions of Axis allies are almost totally ignored, with little or no mention of the Finns, Hungarians, Romanians, Slovaks, Italians and Spanish troops who participated in Operation Barbarossa. The six German divisions in Finland that attempted to take Murmansk and the bloody siege of Odessa are also ignored. Most of the focus is on ArmeeGruppe Center's area of operations, with much less detail on ArmeeGruppe North's efforts to take Leningrad or ArmeeGruppe South's advance to the Dniepr River and beyond. The author's main contention is that the main philosophy of Blitzkrieg - surround enemy armies and they will surrender - did not work in the USSR. The Wehrmacht surrounded numerous Soviet armies but Russian resistance in hopeless pocket battles caused horrendous German losses. Kershaw asserts that the Germans were "victored to death" in the pocket battles around Minsk and Smolensk in July-August 1941, suffering over 100,000 troops killed. As Kershaw states, the extended pocket battles "broke the tempo of Blitzkrieg". The German OKH staff then failed to realize how badly their own units had been hurt in the pocket battles when they ordered Operation "Typhoon", the final push to Moscow in October 1941. Soviet losses had been heavy, but the Germans underestimated Stalin's ability to mobilize new forces. Atrocious winter weather and dogged Soviet counterattacks then brought the weakened Wehrmacht to its knees just outside Moscow. All told, the Wehrmacht suffered 219,000 dead and 730,000 wounded in the nine months between June 1941 and February 1942 (Kershaw fails to mention that about 25% of the wounded would be returned to duty in a few months). Unfortunately, the lack of comprehensiveness tends to undermines Kershaw's hypothesis. He provides statistics on German personnel losses but not on replacements, which makes it difficult to determine how much the Wehrmacht was actually degraded. Statistics on German tank losses also would have been useful; for example, Germany lost 1,805 PzIII and PzIV tanks in this nine-month period, but they built 1,955 in the same period. The idea that "the seedcorn of Blitzkrieg" was lost in 1941 is premature, given the ability of the Germans to mount large-scale Blitzkrieg-type offensives in 1942 and 1943. Certainly the Germans were hurt badly, but the Wehrmacht still had a lot of fight left in it after the defeat before Moscow. Finally, the author's constant references to the "easy" campaigns in France and the "war without garlands" tend to become irritating and deceptive over time. While na�ve German soldiers may have believed that Barbarossa would be over in 6-8 weeks like the earlier Blitzkriegs, it is doubtful that this sentiment was as widespread as the author claims. Kershaw ignores the fact that the simultaneous Afrika Korps campaigns in Libya were also fought without garlands and also exceeded the six-week paradigm. Anti-partisan campaigns in Yugoslavia would also be more "war without garlands". --By R. A Forczyk<br><br>First and foremost this book provies the reader with a view of the Barbarossa campaign through the eyes of the soldiers and civilians involved. Relying heavily on first person accounts (mostly personal diaries) the author does an excellent job conveying the "look and feel" of the campaign. The experiences of both sides are covered well. The second contribution of the book is a critical and well supported analysis of why the German invasion failed. The author presents the theory that the Germans were "victored to death" in the huge encirclement battles that took place during the summer and fall of 1941. Unlike their western counterparts, the Russian soldiers fought to the finish when surrounded, thereby inflicting severe casualties on the German infantry. I found the most interesting analysis to be an examination of the German high command's absolute failure to master the logistic requirements of the campaign. Kershaw does an excellent job outlining the real failure of the Germans - the battle of supplies. Overall I enjoyed this book very much and highly recommend it to the casual reader as well as the serious student of the Eastern Front. --By Keith Schur<br><br>There are numerous books written about the Russo-German war but none that I have seen which offer vivid detail to the degree of War w/o Garlands. The accounts of the fighting are well researched and enable the reader to grasp both the large perspective as well as that of the individual soldier very effectively. I particularly like the inserts from soldiers' letters and diaries. --By A Customer</p><h2>Qualitative Research Methods: Collecting Evidence, Crafting Analysis, Communicating Impact</h2><p><p><i>Qualitative Research Methods</i> is a comprehensive, all-inclusive resource for the theory and practice of qualitative/ethnographic research methodology.</p> <ul> <li>Serves as a &#x201c;how-to&#x201d; guide for qualitative/ethnographic research, detailing how to design a project, conduct interviews and focus groups, interpret and analyze data, and represent it in a compelling manner</li> <li>Demonstrates how qualitative data can be systematically utilized to address pressing personal, organizational, and social problems</li> <li>Written in an engaging style, with in-depth examples from the author&#x2019;s own practice</li> <li>Comprehensive companion website includes sample syllabi, lesson plans, a list of helpful website links, test bank and exam review materials, and exercises and worksheets, available upon publication at www.wiley.com/go/tracy</li> </ul></p><p><p><i>Qualitative Research Methods</i> is a comprehensive, all-inclusive resource for the theoretical underpinnings and practical conduct of qualitative methodology.

In <em>The First World War</em>, one of the most respected historians of his generation offers a brief but hugely readable narrative account of WWI, its causes and consequences, and the many historical controversies surrounding the origin and conduct of the war. <br> Karl von Clausewitz wrote that war is a trinity composed of the policy of the government, the activities of the military, and the passions of the people. Michael Howard argues that "each of these must be taken into account if we are to understand both why the war happened and why it took the course it did." In nine brisk chapters, Howard lays out the historical situation in Europe in 1914, the dispositions of the major belligerents prior to the war, the causes of war, the major campaigns, the entrance of the United States, the crisis, victory, and settlement of the war. Along the way, he offers compelling insights into the political motivations, military actions, and the "passions of the people" that contributed most strongly to the outcome of the war. <br> There is no other short history of WWI on the market today written by a historian of Michael Howard's stature. For anyone wishing to gain a quick but authoritative understanding of one of the most crucial events of the twentieth century, <em>The First World War</em> is the best place to begin.</p><p><br><strong>Sir Michael Howard</strong> has held the Chair of War Studies at King's College London, the Chichele Chair of History of War, and the Regius Chair of Modern History at Oxford, and the Robert A. Lovett Chair of Military and Naval History at Yale. His works include <em>The Franco-Prussian War, The Causes of Wars,</em> <em>War and the Liberal Conscience, The Lessons of History</em>, and <em>War in European History</em>.<br>A distinguished British historian presents the central events of World War I for readers who are curious but unknowledgeable about the conflict. It is comparable in style to the author's recent <i>The Invention of Peace</i> (2001). Succinctly expressive, Howard's style concentrates narrative and interpretation within a few sentences, but a deep historical controversy often lurks behind his concision, such as who was responsible for igniting the war. For those readers who are incredulous that a global conflagration could erupt from an assassination, Howard summarizes how the alliance systems came about, the fears of the nations that contracted them, and the special resentments of a German monarch who embodied "archaic militarism, vaulting ambition, and neurotic insecurity." Just as perplexing, perhaps, is the continuance for four years of trench warfare; once again, Howard compactly explains the slight alterations in tactics that generals believed would achieve a breakthrough, but produced instead the bloodbaths that by 1917-18 broke armies and entire regimes. Also touching on the war's course in Italy and Eastern Europe, Howard elegantly applies his erudition and judgment to this concise introduction. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Ellen Charry argues this premise by example, offering a close reading of a number of classical texts, from the New Testament era to the Reformation, including works of Paul, Augustine, Athanasius, Basil of Caesarea, Anselm, and Calvin. She points out the pastoral and moral aims that shape the teachings of these theologians on a wide range of topics, including the Trinity; human beings as created in the image of God; the incorporation of Jews and Gentiles into the body of Christ in baptism; the incarnation, death, and resurrection of Christ; and the divinity of the Holy Spirit. Charry explains that the very logic of their arguments is shaped by the author's concern for the goodness and happiness that should result from living into the doctrines. She further shows that although the spiritual and pastoral purposes of these writings are many and complex, they are invariably concerned to foster what modern people can, without difficulty, recognize as human dignity--what she calls "excellence"--in action, affection, and self-appraisal.<br></p><p>Ellen Charry is at Princeton Theological Seminary.<br>"A significant contribution to both academic and pastoral theology, and might go a long way toward healing the breach between the two."--Bruce D. Marshall, <em>St. Olaf College</em><p></p><br>"<em>By the Renewing of Your Minds</em> is an illuminating and challenging treatise, especially for those whose vocation is teaching Christian doctrine."--<em>Presbyterion</em><p></p><br>"This ground-breaking volume...is the first to deal at length with the pastoral function of doctrine....Charry has had the daring and imagination to propose a long-range research program which has the possibility of radically redirecting now sterile but still deeply entrenched habits of thinking about doctrine.... Charry's book will prompt much-needed further mining of the doctrinal tradition for its pastoral riches."--<em>Christian Century</em><p></p><br>"Long has doctrinal theology suffered under the suspicion of being utterly irrelevant, even inimical to the life and witness of the church and to the lives of Christian people. Charry has put that old caricature to rest in this remarkable and compelling book...This is a book of great wisdom and passion. It is deeply learned, well written, and carefully researched. Most of all, it is a prophetic call to professional teachers of theology to renew the tradition of teaching doctrine for the formation of virtue and for the knowledge of God."--<em>nterpretation</em><p></p><br>"[Charry] is earnest about her efforts to promote grassroots theological formation. She has a heart for helping everyday people to come to know and love the Lord....A timely and powerful book."--<em>Christianity Today</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Literature: A Introduction to Fiction, Poetry, Drama, and Writing, Interactive Edition (12th Edition)</h2><p><p> <b> <i>Literature, Interactive Edition</i>&nbsp;automatically comes with&nbsp;MyLiteratureLab, Pearson's multimedia Web site.</b>&nbsp; MyLiteratureLab icons are found in the margins of the text along with a list of media assets at the front of the anthology.&nbsp; </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The most popular Literature anthology continues to bring students the finest literature from fables to poetweets.&nbsp; The Twelfth Edition of <i>Literature: An Introductiuon to Fiction, Poetry, Drama, and Writing</i>,edited<i>&nbsp;</i>by X.

This guide covers the entire spectrum of grasses from weedy invaders to rare native species.<br><br> Identifying grasses can be challenging. The grass family is one of the most diverse plant families in the region, and differences between species can be both subtle and minute. This guide provides identification keys, species descriptions, photographs of each species (both in the field and through a microscope), habitats, and range maps. Users will especially appreciate the macrophotographs that illustrate hard-to-see, diagnostic features.<br><br> Biologists, land managers, botanists, and consultants, as well as plant professionals, home gardeners, and amateur plant enthusiasts, will find this guide an indispensable reference for identifying all the grasses they encounter in the diverse habitats of Oregon and Washington.</p><p><b>Cindy Talbott Roch�</b> illustrated grasses for the Flora of North America and has taught grass workshops; her experience with grasses spans both states over four decades.<br><br><b>Richard E.

In only 144 illustrated pages, <i>High Times</i> editor, Danny Danko, covers the basics of successful pot cultivation. This book is a primer that covers:<br></p><ul><li>The basics of setting up a grow room</li><li>Genetics and seeds </li><li>Germination</li><li>Sexing</li><li>Cloning</li><li>Building buds</li><li>Harvesting</li><li>Pest, fungi, molds, and deficiencies</li><li>Concentrates, edibles, tinctures, and topicals</li></ul><p></p><p>This is the novice marijuana grower's handbook that guides readers through the absolute essentials of cannabis horticulture to produce the most potent buds. From where to buy seeds to sowing, nurturing, and maintaining a crop, this handy "Pot Bible" is essential for the perfect harvest.</p></p><p><b>1. Why did you write this book?</b>To create a primer for potential pot growers to get started simply and easily. My book is an entry-level introduction to the many different concepts and techniques that ensure successful harvests, right from the beginning. I've broken down every stage of growth to it's basics to try to give anyone, including those without a green thumb, a healthy start down to path of growing their own&nbsp;cannabis. It's a step-by-step guide that's easy to read and understand.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><br>2. What gives you the authority to write this book?&nbsp;</b>Simply put, I know good weed. I've been growing and working with pot for almost 30 years. I've judged more High Times&nbsp;Cannabis&nbsp;Cups than anyone on earth. It's safe to say I've also visited more marijuana grows than anyone on earth, from the tiniest closets and tents to massive outdoor, greenhouse and warehouse facilities. I've moderated and been on countless cultivation panels at events around the world with all of the top experts in marijuana growing. Due to my travels, I've been able to absorb multiple different ways to produce pot and discern which are the easiest and most effective.&nbsp;<b><br>3. Why should people learn to grow their own pot?&nbsp;</b>There's no better feeling than creating your own medicine and no better hobby than home cultivation. Plus, it's much cheaper and you know exactly what went into it. You know the strain and whether pesticides were used on it. Also, most commercially grown&nbsp;cannabis&nbsp;isn't flushed, dried or cured properly. When you grow your own, you get a superior and affordable product for pennies to the dollar. Plus it's fun!&nbsp;<b><br>4. Will intermediate and expert growers benefit from this book?&nbsp;</b>Absolutely! The book includes many important tips and tricks to increasing yields and producing bigger harvests. Concepts such as creating your own mother-plants will greatly benefit growers of all levels of expertise.&nbsp;<b><br>5. Why did you choose illustrations over photographs?&nbsp;</b>I think many of the concepts are easier to understand from simple illustrations. Techniques such as&nbsp; cloning or pruning can be tough to digest when presented in a complicated textbook-style manner. I seek to simplify the process down to its essential elements and drawings convey that better than photos.&nbsp;<b><br>6. How much does it cost to get started growing your own pot?&nbsp;</b>Prospective growers can get started for under $1000 dollars, depending on how and where they choose to grow. In this book, I illustrate how someone on a limited budget can purchase a simple grow tent and some lighting, then supplement with some air circulation and purification equipment and be well on their way to self-sufficiency.&nbsp;<b><br>7. What are the two biggest mistakes new growers make?&nbsp;</b>Overfeeding and overwatering. Sometimes the best thing to do is just to get out of the plant's way. That's not to say to ignore it - you must stay vigilant about potential pests and problems - but let it grow without interference if everything is looking healthy.&nbsp;<b><br>8. What's the best advice you can give to a new grower?&nbsp;</b>"Never put minor before major." I received this advice early on in my growing career and have put it to good use ever since. Essentially, it means don't let a tiny or barely perceptible problem blind you to a more glaring issue that must be dealt with immediately.&nbsp;<b><br>9. What are the biggest mistakes more experienced growers make?&nbsp;</b>They become too complacent and rest upon their laurels. Each grow is a new opportunity to improve and I can't tell you how many "professional" gardens I've visited with dead or dying leaves on the plants or on the floor. This is an invitation to buds and molds, and yet these experts somehow fail to see the dilemma or diminish the importance.&nbsp;<b><br>10. Why should someone buy this book with so much information available for free on the internet?</b>The information in my book is concise, easy-to-understand and has been compiled over years of research and expertise. There's plenty of different ways to grow&nbsp;cannabis&nbsp;and no one way fits all growers. I've outlined the basics with the idea that the reader can decide about a number of directions they wish to go and grow. There's no dogma - simply the essentials to understanding the life cycle and the processes with the ultimate goal of improving the quality of your pot.&nbsp;"This book gives new growers the exact information they need to grow successful&nbsp;cannabis&nbsp;crops. Danny's simple, direct writing style shines through in his new book that gives you the essentials of success. This work is not filled with unnecessary fluff or unfounded opinions. It is packed with tried and true techniques that produce heavy harvests every crop." - World renown grow author Jorge Cervantes<br>"Danny Danko is a&nbsp;cannabis&nbsp;cultivation expert and one of the industry's most trusted sources of information.

No longer confined to monotone bedding plants, dozens of &#34;unusual&#34; annuals are now available at garden centers in colors and forms far removed from the classic annual bed of pink petunias or red geraniums. In the tradition of his classic Herbaceous Perennial Plants, Allan M. Armitage has compiled descriptions and assessments of 245 genera of true annuals as well as plants that behave like annuals in USDA zones 1-7. Focusing on identifying the plants, successful culture, and their primary garden attributes, Armitage discusses 279 species in detail and summarizes the distinguishing features of hundreds of cultivars, many of which he has tested himself. Classics like begonias and pelargoniums are juxtaposed with newcomers from Australia, and all are subject to Armitage&#39;s critical eye. Color photos and line drawings illustrate the text, and he suggests additional reading in books, articles, and Web sites for many of the covered genera. Armitage bases his descriptions on extensive personal experience. His frank and conversational style keeps potentially dry details fresh, and each entry is liberally sprinkled with strong and sometimes amusing opinions. Useful lists in the appendix are further evidence of his expertise, as he compiles biennials, half-hardy perennials, winter annuals, shade-tolerant plants, fragrant plants, climbing plants, and everlastings. These lists extend the volume&#39;s application beyond a necessary tool for horticulturists and nurserymen to a practical guide for the dedicated home gardener.</p><p>Armitage has compiled descriptions and assessments of 245 genera of true annuals as well as plants that behave like annuals in USDA zones 1-7.

Thus began the Crusades: the bloody and grueling battles pitched between European knights and the Islamic defenders over the course of two hundred years, movements that created the legends of King Arthur and the Holy Grail, military orders such as the Knights Templar, and an unusually rich tradition of art and architecture.<br> In <em>The Oxford Illustrated History of the Crusades</em>, the story of the Crusades is told as never before in an engrossing, authoritative, and comprehensive history that ranges from the preaching of the First Crusade in 1095 to the legacy of the crusading ideals and imagery that continues today. Here are the ideas of apologists, propagandists, and poets about the Crusades, as well as the perceptions and motives of the crusaders themselves and the means by which they joined the movement--crusaders were required to "take the cross" (which involved making a vow, often at an emotional public gatherings under the influence of preachers whose business it was to whip their audiences up into a frenzy) and were foresworn to wear a cross on their clothing until they returned from their mission in the East. The authors describe the elaborate social and civic systems that arose to support the Crusades--taxation, for example, was formalized by the Church and monarchs to raise enormous funds needed to wage war on this scale; nearly 1,000,000 <em>livres tournois</em> were raised from the French church (out of estimated total expenses of some 3,000,000 <em>livres</em>) for Louis IX's first crusade in 1248. And here are vivid descriptions of the battles themselves, frightening, disorienting, and dangerous affairs, with keen and insightful commentary on the reactions of the Muslims to a Christian holy war. Extensively illustrated with hundreds of illustrations, maps, chronologies, and a guide to further reading, <em>The Oxford Illustrated History of the Crusades</em> even includes coverage of crusades outside the eastern Mediterranean region and post-medieval crusades.<br> From descriptions of the battles and homefront conditions, to a throrough evaluation of the clash (and coalescence) of cultures, to the legacy of the crusading movement that continues into our conflict-torn twentieth-century, to the enduring artistic and social changes that the Crusades wrought, <em>The Oxford Illustrated History of the Crusades</em> offers an unsurpassed panorama of one of the great movements in western history. This beautiful work will engage and inform anyone with an interest in the Crusades.</p><p><br><em>About the Editor:</em><br> Jonathan Riley-Smith is Dixie Professor of Ecclesiastical History at the University of Cambridge and is one of the world's leading authorities on the Crusades. He is the author or editor of a number of books including <em>The Atlas of the Crusades</em> and <em>The Crusades: A Short History</em><br>In 1095 Pope Urban II granted absolutions to whomever would reclaim the Holy Land for Christendom. With that assurance began two centuries of Crusades, and the story, in contemporary chronicles, artwork, and castellated ruins, is well treated in this interpretation of the movement to take up the cross. The subject has stirred from historiographical dormancy, says editor Riley-Smith, who ably introduces the definitional questions--What is a Crusade? Who became a Crusader?--and then turns the chapters over to a dozen specialists. They analyze in detail the complex religious, economic, and military aspects, emphasizing the immediate instigation of one Crusade or another--often a Muslim counter-Crusade like Saladin's recapture of Jerusalem in 1187--while reiterating the profound piety and concern for salvation on which the whole process rested. It seems an odd combination of compassion and conquest, aptly expressed in knightly orders such as Hospitallers or the Teutonic Order, so elusive to the modern sensibility. These historians, though, dissolve that psychological barrier, interpreting what impelled the pilgrims, the Muslim reaction, and the political course of holy conflict up through the fall of the last Crusader polity--Malta--in 1798. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i></p><h2>Framley Parsonage (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p><strong>'The fact is, Mark, that you and I cannot conceive the depth of fraud in such a man as that.'</strong><br><br>The Reverend Mark Robarts makes a mistake.

John Szarkowski, an acknowledged master of the art of looking at photographs, explores in this book the unique sensibilities that made Atget one of the greatest artists of the twentieth century and a vital influence on the development of modern and contemporary photography. Szarkowski&#39;s eloquent introductory text and commentaries form an extended essay on the remarkable visual intelligence displayed in these subtle, sometimes enigmatic pictures. Atget was a commercial photographer who devoted more then thirty years of his life to the task of documenting the city of Paris, its environs, and the French countryside in more than eight thousand photographs. In the process, he created an oeuvre that brilliantly explains the great richness, complexity, and authentic character of his native culture. His uncompromising eye recorded the picturesque villages and landscape of France; the storied chateaux and the romantic parks and gardens of the ancien r�gime of Louis XIV; and, in Paris, architectural details, private courtyards, quaint shop windows, curious buildings and streets, and various denizens of the urban scene of his times. Atget died almost unknown in 1927, although groups of his prints were included in various Paris archives. In 1925 the young American artist Berenice Abbott had discovered his work, and after his death she arranged to buy his archives with the help of art dealer Julien Levy; in 1968 that collection was purchased by the Museum of Modern Art.</p><p>In this day and age, we've pretty much taken photography for granted as an integral part of everyday life. There is the immediacy of Polaroids and the limitlessness of disposable cameras, which make a picture taken today a distant cousin to the practice of early photography. Occasionally we need reminding of the roots of photographic image-making, the glass plates, hand-coated emulsion, and massive amounts of other accouterments that were needed to make one image. In <i>Atget</i>, a selection from the lifetime work of legendary French photographer Eug�ne Atget (1857-1927), we enter the world of early-20th-century photography, which was beginning to bid farewell to the handcrafted picture. <p> Atget was poised on the cusp between the techniques and materials of early photography and the moment things began to change and modern photography was born. From a laborious and time-consuming process came a much faster method that changed the nature of photography forever. Seemingly overnight, the photograph went from being a precious object to something on its way to being accessible to all. Atget was among the first generation to photographically capture the world of ordinary citizens. While the subject matter was new, he was nevertheless steeped in the tradition of the old-world photograph. A crooked door knocker is captured with loving attention to detail, an air of preciousness still present. Spindly trees, store windows, public gardens--each picture is delicate and romantic. It makes you wonder if absolutely everything was more beautiful in France. Included in the book are insightful commentaries for each of the 100 tritone photographs and five duotones, plus a great introduction by John Szarkowski, former director of the Department of Photography at the MOMA. <i>--J.P. Cohen</i></p>Eug ne Atget was a commercial photographer who spent 30 years producing more than 8000 pictures of Paris and its surrounding countryside before his death in 1927, when American photographer Berenice Abbott purchased his archives. Though he was unknown during his lifetime, his place in photography continues to grow; at times, he seems to be the Gallic brother of Walker Evans. Was Atget's aim to produce a kind of travel guide to a part of France he revered or to capture the elegance of places, courtyards, and gardens for wealthy clients? We will never know, but both of these books sum up the mystery of his intent and the serenity of his camera eye by describing his work as "enigmatic." Szarkowski, who may be our best navigator through images of lightDhe was director of the department of photography at MoMA from 1962 to 1991Dcarefully gathers 100 photographs, taking us through a sepia-toned era where Atget's silence abounds as he lovingly describes what the photographer captured. The Getty book, part of the museum's "In Focus" series, is less ambitious and might serve as a small but representative introduction to the special legacy of Atget. Useful descriptions accompanying each picture will help students, but the black-and-white reproduction and the two-column text make the images seem colder and the book less inviting than Szarkowski's sepia and margin-to-margin text. Where budgets allow, Szarkowski's approach to Atget is recommended, with the Getty version a second choice.DDavid Bryant, New Canaan Lib., CT <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Tragedies Volume 2 (Everyman&#39;s Library Classics)</h2><p>Volume 1 of the new Everyman Shakespeare, published in 1992, included the four major tragedies; &#34;Hamlet&#34;, &#34;King Lear&#34;, &#34;Othello&#34; and &#34;Macbeth&#34;. Volume 2 completes the survey of Shakespeare&#39;s tragic output with &#34;Romeo and Juliet&#34;, &#34;Julius Caesar&#34;, &#34;Antony and Cleopatra&#34;, &#34;Coriolanus&#34;, &#34;Troilus and Cressida&#34; and &#34;Titus Andronicus&#34;. The edited texts of the plays are supplemented with bibliographies, a chronology of Shakespeare&#39;s life and times, and an introduction in which Professor Tony Tanner examines Shakespeare&#39;s evolution as a tragedian while also providing detailed discussions of the individual plays. The two-volume edition of the tragedies will eventually form part of a complete Shakespeare (plays and poems) in eight volumes.</p><p>An appealing collection of the great tragedies of Shakespeare, these plays express the full force of his dramatic and psychological insight, exploring the fatal flaws that lead to the fall of the mighty from good fortune. The hesitant vengefulness of Hamlet; the vain selfishness of Lear; the irrational jealousy of Othello; the cunning destructiveness of Iago; the romantic impulsiveness of Romeo; the murderous ambition of Lady Macbeth--all of these characters are burned into the collective psyche of world culture.Just why the history of Rome was so important to the Elizabethans, and how and to what ends Shakespeare imaginatively deployed that history, will be made a little clearer in the course of this introduction.</p><h2>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorders: A Complete Guide to Getting Well and Staying Well</h2><p>Morbid obsessions with sex, germs, or with one's appearance, and uncontrollable compulsions to hoard objects, to check and recheck locks, or to pull one's hair are just a few of the symptoms of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorders, which afflict over ten million Americans.

The application of justice through its developing stages within the various environments and communities of the Old and New Testaments is then analyzed. Enrique Nardoni reads the ancient and biblical texts in their own historical, social, and intellectual context, but he also relates them to contemporary culture, where his readers are participants, not mere spectators. Translated for the first time into English, this ground-breaking work will serve as an outstanding resource for teaching and discussing the issue of social justice in universities, seminaries, and religious communities.</p><p>Enrique Nardoni was Professor Emeritus at the University of Dallas (Irving), where he taught biblical studies for over two decades.</p><h2>Northanger Abbey (Modern Library Classics)</h2><p>Jane Austen&#x2019;s first novel, <i>Northanger Abbey</i>&#x2014;published posthumously in 1818&#x2014;tells the story of Catherine Morland and her dangerously sweet nature, innocence, and sometime self-delusion. Though Austen&#x2019;s fallible heroine is repeatedly drawn into scrapes while vacationing at Bath and during her subsequent visit to Northanger Abbey, Catherine eventually triumphs, blossoming into a discerning woman who learns truths about love, life, and the heady power of literature. The satirical <i>Northanger Abbey</i> pokes fun at the gothic novel while earnestly emphasizing caution to the female sex.<br><br>This Modern Library Paperback Classic is set from the first edition of 1818.</p><p>Though <i>Northanger Abbey</i> is one of Jane Austen's earliest novels, it was not published until after her death--well after she'd established her reputation with works such as <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>, <i>Emma</i>, and <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>. Of all her novels, this one is the most explicitly literary in that it is primarily concerned with books and with readers. In it, Austen skewers the novelistic excesses of her day made popular in such 18th-century Gothic potboilers as Ann Radcliffe's <i>The Mysteries of Udolpho</i>. Decrepit castles, locked rooms, mysterious chests, cryptic notes, and tyrannical fathers all figure into <i>Northanger Abbey</i>, but with a decidedly satirical twist. Consider Austen's introduction of her heroine: we are told on the very first page that "no one who had ever seen Catherine Morland in her infancy, would have supposed her born to be an heroine." The author goes on to explain that Miss Morland's father is a clergyman with "a considerable independence, besides two good livings--and he was not in the least addicted to locking up his daughters." Furthermore, her mother does <i>not</i> die giving birth to her, and Catherine herself, far from engaging in "the more heroic enjoyments of infancy, nursing a dormouse, feeding a canary-bird, or watering a rose-bush" vastly prefers playing cricket with her brothers to any girlish pastimes. <p> Catherine grows up to be a passably pretty girl and is invited to spend a few weeks in Bath with a family friend. While there she meets Henry Tilney and his sister Eleanor, who invite her to visit their family estate, Northanger Abbey. Once there, Austen amuses herself and us as Catherine, a great reader of Gothic romances, allows her imagination to run wild, finding dreadful portents in the most wonderfully prosaic events. But Austen is after something more than mere parody; she uses her rapier wit to mock not only the essential silliness of "horrid" novels, but to expose the even more horrid workings of polite society, for nothing Catherine imagines could possibly rival the hypocrisy she experiences at the hands of her supposed friends. In many respects <i>Northanger Abbey</i> is the most lighthearted of Jane Austen's novels, yet at its core is a serious, unsentimental commentary on love and marriage, 19th-century British style. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>One of the first of Jane Austen&#39;s novels to be written, and one of the last to be published, Northanger Abbey is both an amusing story of how a naive girl enters society and wins the affection of a witty young clergyman, and a high-spirited parody of the lurid Gothic novels that were popular during Austen&#39;s youth. In the process it features a vivid account of social life in late eighteenth-century Bath, and Austen&#39;s famous defence of the novel as a literary form. This edition, based on the text of the novel as published posthumously in 1818, is accompanied by explanatory notes, and an appendix summarising the plots and situations of the Gothic fictions that form the basis of much of Austen&#39;s comedy. In addition there is an extensive critical introduction covering the context, publication, and critical history of the novel, a chronology of Austen&#39;s life, and authoritative textual apparatus.</p><h2>Anthology of World Scriptures</h2><p>With ANTHOLOGY OF WORLD SCRIPTURES, 9th Edition you will encounter the most notable and instructive sacred texts from major world religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Shinto, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

After spilling his secrets to the CIA, Stashinsky was put on trial in what would be the most publicized assassination case of the entire Cold War.

Stashinsky's testimony, implicating the Kremlin rulers in political assassinations carried out abroad, shook the world of international politics.

In <i>Brain Storms</i>, the award-winning journalist Jon Palfreman tells their story, a story that became his own when he was diagnosed with the debilitating illness. <br> Palfreman chronicles how scientists have worked to crack the mystery of what was once called the shaking palsy, from the earliest clinical descriptions of tremors, gait freezing, and micrographia to the cutting edge of neuroscience, and charts the victories and setbacks of a massive international effort to best the disease. He takes us back to the late 1950s and the discovery of L-dopa. He delves into a number of other therapeutic approaches to this perplexing condition, from partial lobotomies and deep brain stimulation to neural grafting. And he shares inspiring stories of brave individuals living with Parkinson's, from a former professional ballet dancer who tricks her body to move freely again to a patient who cannot walk but astounds doctors when he is able to ride a bicycle with no trouble at all.<br> With the baby boom generation beginning to retire and the population steadily aging, the race is on to discover a means to stop or reverse neurodegenerative conditions like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. <i>Brain Storms</i> is the long-overdue, riveting, and deeply personal story of that race, and a passionate, insightful, and urgent look into the lives of those affected.</p></p><p><b>Jon Palfreman</b>, Ph.D., is a professor emeritus of journalism at the University of Oregon.

Organized alphabetically for easy accessibility, the book includes basic and advanced procedures on key topics, such as: infection control, specimen collection, physical treatments, drug administration, IV therapy, hemodynamic monitoring, as well as procedures related to body systems such as chest tubes, peripheral nerve stimulation, and intra-abdominal pressure monitoring.</p><p></p><h2>Music for Silenced Voices: Shostakovich and His Fifteen Quartets</h2><p><p>Most previous books about Dmitri Shostakovich have focused on either his symphonies and operas, or his relationship to the regime under which he lived, or both, since these large-scale works were the ones that attracted the interest and sometimes the condemnation of the Soviet authorities. <i>Music for Silenced Voices</i> looks at Shostakovich through the back door, as it were, of his fifteen quartets, the works which his widow characterized as a "diary, the story of his soul." The silences and the voices were of many kinds, including the political silencing of adventurous writers, artists, and musicians during the Stalin era; the lost voices of Shostakovich's operas (a form he abandoned just before turning to string quartets); and the death-silenced voices of his close friends, to whom he dedicated many of these chamber works.</p><p>Wendy Lesser has constructed a fascinating narrative in which the fifteen quartets, considered one at a time in chronological order, lead the reader through the personal, political, and professional events that shaped Shostakovich's singular, emblematic twentieth-century life. Weaving together interviews with the composer's friends, family, and colleagues, as well as conversations with present-day musicians who have played the quartets, Lesser sheds new light on the man and the musician. One of the very few books about Shostakovich that is aimed at a general rather than an academic audience, <i>Music for Silenced Voices</i> is a pleasure to read; at the same time, it is rigorously faithful to the known facts in this notoriously complicated life. It will fill readers with the desire to hear the quartets, which are among the most compelling and emotionally powerful monuments of the past century's music.</p></p><p><p><b>Wendy Lesser</b>, the editor of <i>The Threepenny Review</i>, is the author of seven previous nonfiction books and one novel. She divides her year between Berkeley and New York.</p>&#x201c;<i>Music for Silenced Voices</i> is a sensitive and enlightening meditation. . . . Lesser, in other words, is giving Shostakovich back to his listeners.&#x201d;&#x2014;Paul Mitchinson, <i>Washington Post</i> (Paul Mitchinson <i>The Washington Post</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Riveting.&#x201d;&#x2014;Laurence Vittes, <i>The Huffington Post</i> (Laurence Vittes <i>The Huffington Post</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;This book is a paean to Shostakovich&#x2019;s quartets and their significance.&nbsp; In her listening, Lesser...is literate, sensitive, and imaginative.&#x201d;&#x2014;Edward Rothstein, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i> (Edward Rothstein <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Lesser has written a sensitive biography...a generous reflection on his life and chamber music.&#x201d;&#x2014;Michael O&#x2019;Donnell, <i>The Nation</i> (Michael O'Donnell <i>The Nation</i>)<br><br>"An elegant, thought-provoking synthesis of the current state of knowledge and ideas about one of the most celebrated and controversial composers of the twentieth century. It is a delight to read, and reread."&#x2014;Laurel E. Fay (Laurel E. Fay)<br><br>"Lesser moves between looking at the life as a way of understanding the quartets, and using the music of the quartets as a way of comprehending the complexities of Shostakovich and the manner in which he both negotiated and was pushed through the history of Stalin&#x2019;s Soviet Union. The always imprecise links between a life and the work that comes out of it are beautifully elucidated. The idea of the quartets as songs for not singing resonates with many other elements of Shostakovich&#x2019;s contradictory life."&#x2014;William Kentridge (William Kentridge)<br><br> &#x201c;Wendy Lesser has written a fantastic book that is as exciting as a detective story. <i>Music for Silenced Voices</i> is a book for those who love Shostakovich and also for those who are going to love Shostakovich after they read it. A must read.&#x201d;&#x2014;Menahem Pressler<br> (Menahem Pressler)<br><br>"A sensitive biography. . . . Her enthusiasm for the quartets is infectious."&#x2014;Michael O'Donnell, <i>The Nation</i> (Michael O'Donnell <i>The Nation</i>)<br><br>"What makes Lesser's book such a ripping good read, in addition to deeply considered music appreciation, is her intelligently personal involvement with the subject."&#x2014;Jonathan Kiefer, <i>SF Weekly</i> (Jonathan Kiefer <i>SF Weekly</i>)<br><br>"A sensitive and enlightening meditation. . . . Lesser is giving Shostakovich back to his listeners."&#x2014;Paul Mitchinson, <i>The Washington Post</i> (Paul Mitchinson <i>The Washington Post</i>)</p><h2>The Formation of a Persecuting Society: Authority and Deviance in Western Europe 950-1250</h2><p>The tenth to the thirteenth centuries in Europe saw the appearance of popular heresy and the establishment of the Inquisition, the expropriation and mass murder of Jews, and the propagation of elaborate measures to segregate lepers from the healthy and curtail their civil rights. These were traditionally seen as distinct and separate developments, and explained in terms of the problems which their victims presented to medieval society. In this stimulating book, first published in 1987 and now widely regarded as a a classic in medieval history, R. I. Moore argues that the coincidences in the treatment of these and other minority groups cannot be explained independently, and that all are part of a pattern of persecution which now appeared for the first time to make Europe become, as it has remained, a persecuting society. <br> <p>In this new edition, R. I. Moore updates and extends his original argument with a new, final chapter, &#x201c;A Persecuting Society&#x201d;. Here and in a new preface and critical bibliography, he considers the impact of a generation&#x2019;s research and refines his conception of the &#x201c;persecuting society&#x201d; accordingly, addressing criticisms of the first edition.</p></p><p><b>R.

The Floating Piers</h2><p><p>From June 18 to July 3, 2016, 100 kilometers east of Milan and 200 kilometers west of Venice, thousands of people will walk on water. The Floating Piers by Christo and Jeanne-Claude deploys 70,000 square meters of shimmering yellow fabric above a modular floating dock system of 220,000 high-density polyethylene cubes to create a temporary three-kilometer walkway across the surface of Lake Iseo, connecting the mainland to the islands of Monte Isola and San Paolo.</p><p>The piers are 16 meters wide and approximately 40 centimeters high, with sloping sides. Visitors experience the artwork by walking from Sulzano to Monte Isola and over to San Paolo. The mountains surrounding the lake also offer a bird&#x2019;s-eye view of the project, revealing unnoticed angles and perspectives.The Floating Piers is Christo and Jeanne-Claude&#x2019;s first large-scale project since they realized The Gates in 2005 and draws upon their established history of projects in Italy, including Wrapped Fountain and Wrapped Medieval Tower in Spoleto, 1968; Wrapped Monuments in Milan, 1970; and The Wall &#x2013; Wrapped Roman Wall in Rome, 1973&#x2013;74. As with all of Christo and Jeanne-Claude&#x2019;s projects, The Floating Piers is funded entirely through the sale of Christo&#x2019;s original works of art. After the 16-day exhibition, all components will be removed and recycled.This book presents rich photographic coverage of The Floating Piers alongside sketches, models, documents and designs, revealing the process behind this waterborne work of art. Incorporating everything from approval procedures to the manufacture of fabric and anchoring elements, it testifies not only to Christo and Jeanne-Claude&#x2019;s unique creative imagination but also to the immense technical, bureaucratic, and logistical feats that allowed the concept to take float.</p></p><p>Wolfgang Volz has worked with Christo and Jeanne-Claude as the exclusive photographer of their works since 1971.

With the telescope now at the apex of its imaging capabilities, this second edition adds another chapter with more than 36 completely new images, including the first publication of a four-page fold-out of the Andromeda Galaxy, the nearest spiral galaxy to Earth, revealing more than one million individual stars. </p><p> Thanks to Dickinson's expertise with Hubble's history and discoveries and his access to top Hubble scientists for insight and accuracy, the text includes facts and tidbits not found in any other book. Combined with 330 brilliant images, the clear, succinct and illuminating narrative brings to life the fascinating forces at work in the universe. </p></p><p><p> Terence Dickinson is the author of 15 astronomy books, including the international bestseller <i>NightWatch</i> and <i>The Backyard Astronomer's Guide. </i> </p><ul><p><b>INTRODUCTION</b> </p><p> In addition to being one of the greatest scientific instruments of all time, the Hubble Space Telescope has given humanity a spectacular legacy of beautiful images of the universe. The best of these are displayed--and explained--in this book. </p><p> As a teenager in the 1950s, I was captivated by the science fiction of the brilliant visionary Arthur C. Clarke. Browsing the local library, I stumbled upon Clarke's early nonfiction work <i>The Exploration of Space</i>, published in 1951. Half a century later, <i>The New York Times</i> described this classic text as "a seamless blend of scientific expertise and poetic imagination that helped usher in the space age." </p><p> It was in the pages of Clarke's book that I first encountered the concept of a telescope in orbit around our planet. This telescope would peer at the universe from well above the interference of the Earth's ever turbulent atmosphere, which relentlessly blurs the view in ground-based telescopes and makes stars twinkle. Ahead of his time, Clarke outlined the advantages of an orbiting telescope compared with a telescope that might, at some future point, be installed on the Moon's surface, as had been suggested decades earlier. "Even the Moon's extremely tenuous atmosphere might affect certain delicate observations," he wrote. "[Moreover,] an observatory in space would be able to survey the complete sphere of the sky." </p><p> The orbiting scope should even be able to detect planets of nearby stars, enthused Clarke, "something quite out of the question with Earth-based equipment." I couldn't wait! During breaks at my first summer job in the shipping department of a publishing house, I made endless pencil sketches on large sheets of brown paper. I imagined just what the photos from that great eye-in-the-sky would look like--images that would show surface details on the moons of Jupiter, views deep within the core of the globular cluster M13, and so on--until my boss saw what I was up to and cautioned me not to waste any more shipping paper. </p><p> Today, the orbiting telescope Clarke envisioned is known as the Hubble Space Telescope, and it has been in service since 1990. That telescope has captured stupendous full-color images that depict the subjects of my crude brown-paper sketches and hundreds more of objects I hadn't yet conjured. What a pleasure it has been to select more than 300 of Hubble's best cosmic portraits for this book. While many of these images have never before appeared in print outside scientific journals and research publications, some were released by the Space Telescope Science Institute as recently as spring 2012. All are accompanied by captions and text that will serve as navigational tools as you undertake this breathtaking journey. </p><p> <i><b>Hubble's Universe</b></i> is a celebration of the astonishing achievements of a remarkable discovery machine. Enjoy the excursion! </p><p> --<i>Terence Dickinson</i></p></ul></p><h2>Death in the Tunnel (British Library Crime Classics)</h2><p><p><strong>Mystery crime fiction written in the Golden Age of Murder</strong></p><p>"This offering in the British Library Crime Classics series is part of a popular subgenre of the time, called the 'railway murder mystery.' The train setting was ideal for encasing a wide variety of people in one place, giving them myriad chances for meetings and murder." &#x2015;<em>Booklist</em></p><p>On a dark November evening, Sir Wilfred Saxonby is travelling alone in the 5 o'clock train from Cannon Street, in a locked compartment. The train slows and stops inside a tunnel; and by the time it emerges again minutes later, Sir Wilfred has been shot dead, his heart pierced by a single bullet. Suicide seems to be the answer, even though no reason can be found. Inspector Arnold of Scotland Yard thinks again when he learns that a mysterious red light in the tunnel caused the train to slow down. </p><p>Finding himself stumped by the puzzle, Arnold consults his friend Desmond Merrion, a wealthy amateur expert in criminology. To Merrion it seems that the dead man fell victim to a complex conspiracy&#x2015;but the investigators are puzzled about the conspirators' motives, as well as their identities. Can there be a connection with Sir Wilfred's seemingly untroubled family life, his highly successful business, or his high-handed and unforgiving personality? And what is the significance of the wallet found on the corpse, and the bank notes that it contained?</p></p><p><p><strong>MILES BURTON</strong> was a pseudonym of Cecil Street (1884-1964), a British soldier who became a prolific novelist in the 1920s. He was the author of approximately 140 detective novels, of which the most highly regarded were published under the names Miles Burton and John Rhode.</p>Death in the Tunnel is certainly not a character-driven novel. I would say that character development is kept to a bare minimum. But the abundance of clues and the way that they are shared with readers, keeps one reading to see who did it.~~~The novel was first published in 1936. It has recently been republished. I am glad to see more golden-age mystery novels being brought back into print. This is one of my favorite genres. (<i>NetGalley</i>)<br><br>This offering in the British Library Crime Classics series (which reissues out-of-print mysteries from the Golden Age of crime fiction, between WWI and WWII) is part of a popular subgenre of the time, called the &#x201c;railway murder mystery.&#x201d; The train setting (think Christie&#x2019;s Murder on the Orient Express, 1934, published two years before this one) was ideal for encasing a wide variety of people in one place, giving them myriad chances for meetings and murder. Death in the Tunnel is a variant of the locked-room mystery. A train comes to a screeching halt in the middle of a two-and-a-half-mile-long tunnel. The body of Sir Willfred Saxonby is discovered shot to death afterward, in a locked first-class compartment. All the evidence points to suicide, but, as a Scotland Yard inspector, aided by his friend, a brilliant amateur sleuth, investigates, what seem to be trifles in timing and coincidence point to murder. Who knew railroad timetables and tunnel gradients could make for so much suspense? (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>Death in the Tunnel is an old style mystery. The main focus is on the "how" and not on the "why" the crime was committed. In a way it was like a Clue game, the reader can follow the trail of clues and try to find the murderer. I enjoyed it. (<i>GoodReads</i>)<br><br>It's so common for a mystery to set up a really corking situation, only to fizzle in the solution and that doesn't happen here. The plotting was clever, if a bit confusing at a time ("who's that, now?"), and the solution satisfying. I look forward to more. (<i>NetGalley</i>)<br><br>"Death in the Tunnel" is a mystery novel that was originally published in 1936. It's a complex, clue-based puzzle mystery. The Inspector was quite willing to go with the "obvious suspect," but things didn't quite add up so he consulted with his imaginative, amateur sleuth friend. This friend actually used quite a lot of logic to form suggestions of what to look into further. The focus of the story was on the details of the crime rather than on developing the characters or setting.~~~For all its complexity, I was quite certain of whodunit and had an overall idea of howdunit by about 40% of the way through. The author did a good job of drawing attention away from important points, though, and the main characters weren't stupid. It's simply that it took some time for them to work through the conflicting clues. The story kept my attention as I was curious to see the motive (which later became clear), the exact details of how it was done, and even how the main characters figured it out.~~~There was no sex. There was a minor amount of bad language. Overall, I'd recommend this intriguing mystery. (<i>GenreReviews</i>)<br><br>Death in the Tunnel is an intriguing book from the Golden Age of Detective fiction and comes recommended especially for fans of "train crime." There's no CSI&#x2015;just painstaking, logical police work, and in this book, the troubling aspects of the case are easy to grasp. (<i>NetGalley</i>)<br><br>I can't say much at all about the plot without giving too much away, but I can tell you many things I loved about this book.~~~I believed in all of the people in the story, and the things they said and did. The crime was extraordinary, but I could quite easily believe that this was the same world where my grandparents lived, and that maybe they had read about the case in the newspaper, and talked about it.~~~I appreciated the relationship between Arnold and Merrion. One was a steady worker with all of the resources of the police at his disposal; the other was an ideas man in possession of the sharpest of minds. They made a great team and they had a mutual respect that I really appreciated.~~~And I loved that small pieces of evidence were assembled, steadily building a case against the murderer. The plotting is clever and complex, red herrings are very well deployed, and the story twisted and turned beautifully. It's very much a puzzle mystery; there's a solid motive for the murder, the psychology is there but it is very simple.~~~I had to keep turning the pages, and I was sorry to reach the last one.~~~But I see that Inspector Arnold and Desmond Merrion investigated quite a few more cases, that one is already on its way back into print, and I hope that others will follow.

This volume catalogues portraits by Sargent from 1874, when he began his training in Paris, and covers pictures painted while he was establishing his reputation in Paris, during his early years in England, and on his first professional visit to America in 1887. Volume two will record portraits painted from 1890 until the end of the artist&#x2019;s career. The entire catalogue raisonn� will bring together nearly 600 portraits, some 1,600 subject pictures and landscapes, and three mural cycles. <br><br>The early portraits in this book range from private images of Sargent&#x2019;s family and friends to studies of writers and fellow artists and formal portraits of Parisian celebrities and patrons in France, England, and America. These include his most controversial work, <i>Madame Gautreau</i>, and studies of some of the major artistic figures of the day: <i>Claude Monet</i>, <i>Robert Louis Stevenson</i>, and <i>Ellen Terry</i> in her role as Lady Macbeth.<br><br>Each work is catalogued in depth, with a biographical account of the sitter, a discussion of the contemporary context of the painting, and a detailed provenance, exhibition history, and bibliography. Almost all of the paintings are shown, mostly in color, including some that have never been reproduced before. The fruit of some sixteen years of research, this valuable reference provides a broad and comprehensive view of Sargent&#x2019;s art.<br><br>Published for the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art</p><p><b>Richard Ormond </b>is Director of the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, England. <b>Elaine Kilmurray </b>has published a number of articles on Sargent.<br>"This is the first volume in a complete-works catalog that will include oil paintings, watercolors and pastels by the 19th Century American expatriate. . . . It encompasses a number of his most famous paintings, reproducing them beautifully in color and providing a number of luscious closeups of his virtuoso brushwork. The superb introductory essay sets his work against artistic theories of the period, and detailed entries on the paintings provide even biographical accounts of the sitters. A book that amply justifies its sixteen years of labor&#x2015;and not only to specialists."&#x2015;Alan G. Artner, <i>Chicago Tribune<br></i><br>"This second volume of Ormond and Kilmurray&#x2019;s comprehensively researched catalogue raisonn� of Sargent&#x2019;s work in oil, watercolor, and pastel provides the most extensive provenance, publication, and exhibition histories to date for nearly 150 extant and untraced or destroyed portraits and portrait studies from the decade during which the artist reached the pinnacle of his career. . . . [An] impressive package, [and] an invaluable research tool for scholars. Essential. Upper-division undergraduates through faculty and researchers."&#x2014;<i>Choice</i><br>"This magnificent, erudite compilation demonstrates fittingly that Sargent was the outstanding society portraitist of his age. . . .

It weaves together the political, economic, social and cultural developments of the period and examines themes such as the relationship between state, civil society and the citizen; the emergency of mass politics (including women's emancipation movements); the impact of economic growth on society, politics and culture; and the development of identities (including gender, class and nation). While discussing events within the great powers, this useful text also ties smaller countries experiences into the narrative, for a comprehensive and thorough overview of Europe in the 19th century.<br></p><p>This book explores Europe's 'long nineteenth century', from the French Revolution in 1789 until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. Telling the story of how Europeans entered politics in the fiery trials of revolution and industrialization, the account opens with the French Revolution, passes through the crucible of the 1848 Revolutions and ends with the emergence of mass movements - socialist, revolutionary, nationalist and authoritarian - which anticipated those of the twentieth century.<br><br>Along the way, Michael Rapport describes how people experienced the changes which affected European society, including:<br>- poverty and living conditions<br>- the abolition of serfdom (particularly in Russia)<br>- the changing status and role of women<br>- the expansion of education and literacy<br>- the growth of popular culture.<br>Rapport also considers international developments such as:<br>- warfare<br>- the unifications of Italy and Germany<br>- the emergence of new states in the Balkans<br>- the origins of the First World War<br>- European imperialism across the globe.<br><br>Paying attention to all of the major powers, but also to others, particularly Spain, Italy and the Balkan states, this is an ideal introduction for all those interested in the history of Europe in the nineteenth century.<b>Michael Rapport</b> is a Lecturer in History at the University of Stirling.<br></p><h2>The Marble Faun and A Green Bough</h2><p>Scarce First Random House Edition, 1960.

Appendix: General World War II Histories and Reference Works</p><h2>Kim (Everyman&#39;s Library Classics)</h2><p>Kipling&#39;s masterpiece is perhaps the most remarkable literary product of British India. The story of a half-caste boy, part Indian part Irish who journeys throughout the subcontinent with an aged lama in search of religious enlightenment, the nominal plot revolves around the Great Game: the struggle between Britian and Russia for control of Afghanistan. But the glory of the book lies less in the amusing picaresque adventures than in the unsurpassed panorama of Indian life they evoke: brilliant, moving and intensely alive.</p><p>One of the particular pleasures of reading <i>Kim</i> is the full range of emotion, knowledge, and experience that Rudyard Kipling gives his complex hero. Kim O'Hara, the orphaned son of an Irish soldier stationed in India, is neither innocent nor victimized. Raised by an opium-addicted half-caste woman since his equally dissolute father's death, the boy has grown up in the streets of Lahore: <blockquote> Though he was burned black as any native; though he spoke the vernacular by preference, and his mother-tongue in a clipped uncertain sing-song; though he consorted on terms of perfect equality with the small boys of the bazar; Kim was white--a poor white of the very poorest. </blockquote> From his father and the woman who raised him, Kim has come to believe that a great destiny awaits him. The details, however, are a bit fuzzy, consisting as they do of the woman's addled prophecies of "'a great Red Bull on a green field, and the Colonel riding on his tall horse, yes, and'--dropping into English--'nine hundred devils.'" <p> In the meantime, Kim amuses himself with intrigues, executing "commissions by night on the crowded housetops for sleek and shiny young men of fashion." His peculiar heritage as a white child gone native, combined with his "love of the game for its own sake," makes him uniquely suited for a bigger game. And when, at last, the long-awaited colonel comes along, Kim is recruited as a spy in Britain's struggle to maintain its colonial grip on India. Kipling was, first and foremost, a man of his time; born and raised in India in the 19th century, he was a fervid supporter of the Raj. Nevertheless, his portrait of India and its people is remarkably sympathetic. Yes, there is the stereotypical Westernized Indian Babu Huree Chander with his atrocious English, but there is also Kim's friend and mentor, the Afghani horse trader Mahub Ali, and the gentle Tibetan lama with whom Kim travels along the Grand Trunk Road. The humanity of his characters consistently belies Kipling's private prejudices, and raises <i>Kim</i> above the mere ripping good yarn to the level of a timeless classic. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Kim is an orphan, living from hand to mouth in the teeming streets of Lahore. One day he meets a man quite unlike anything in his wide experience, a Tibetan lama on a quest. Kim's life suddenly acquires meaning and purpose as he becomes the lama's guide and protector--his chela. Other forces are at work as Kim is sucked into the intrigue of the Great Game and travels the Grand Trunk Road with his lama.<p></p><p>How Kim and the lama meet their respective destinies on the road and in the mountains of India forms one of the most compelling adventure tales of all time.</p></p><h2>The Food Truck Handbook: Start, Grow, and Succeed in the Mobile Food Business</h2><p><b>How to start, grow, and succeed in the food truck business.</b> <p>Food trucks have become a wildly popular and important part of the hospitality industry.&nbsp; Consumers are flocking to these mobile food businesses in droves, inspiring national food truck competitions and even a show dedicated to the topic on The Food Network.&nbsp; The relatively low cost of entry as compared to starting a restaurant, combined with free and low-cost ways to market them to the masses via platforms like social media, are just two of the reasons that food truck business are drawing in budding entrepreneurs.</p> <p>Author David Weber, a food truck advocate and entrepreneur himself, is here to offer his practical, step-by-step advice to achieving your mobile food mogul dreams in <i>The Food Truck Handbook.&nbsp;</i> This book cuts through all of the hype to give both hopeful entrepreneurs and already established truck owners an accurate portrayal of life on the streets.

Marieb</b>, taking the student's perspective into account has always been an integral part of her teaching style. Dr. Marieb began her teaching career at Springfield College, where she taught anatomy and physiology to physical education majors. She then joined the faculty of the Biological Science Division of Holyoke Community College after receiving her Ph.D. in zoology from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. </p> <p>While teaching at Holyoke Community College, where many of her students were pursuing nursing degrees, she developed a desire to better understand the relationship between the scientific study of the human body and the clinical aspects of the nursing practice. To that end, while continuing to teach full time, Dr. Marieb pursued her nursing education, which culminated in a Master of Science degree with a clinical specialization in gerontology from the University of Massachusetts. It is this experience, along with stories from the field&#x2014;including those of former students, now in health careers&#x2014;that has informed the development of the unique perspective and accessibility for which her texts and laboratory manuals are known.</p> <p>In her ongoing commitment to students and her realization of the challenges they face, Dr. Marieb has given generously to provide opportunities for students to further their education. She contributes to the New Directions, New Careers Program at Holyoke Community College by providing several full-tuition scholarships each year for women returning to college after a hiatus or who are attending college for the first time and would otherwise be unable to continue with their studies without financial support. She funds the E. N. Marieb Science Research Awards at Mount Holyoke College, which promotes research by undergraduate science majors, and generously contributed to the University of Massachusetts at Amherst where she provided funding for reconstruction and instrumentation of a cutting-edge cytology research laboratory that bears her name. </p> <p>In 1994, Dr. Marieb received the Benefactor Award from the National Council for Resource Development, American Association of Community Colleges, which recognizes her ongoing sponsorship of student scholarships, faculty teaching awards, and other academic contributions to Holyoke Community College.

Hinton&#39;s The Outsiders is a young adult novel of enduring power. This Penguin Modern Classics edition is published with an introduction by Jodi Picoult, author of My Sister&#39;s Keeper. The Greasers and the rich-kid Socs are at war on the Tulsa streets. Ponyboy, a fourteen-year-old brawler, chainsmoker and dreamer, is a fiercely loyal greaser. But a single, murderous catastrophe is to wrench him from his old life and overturn everything he thinks he knows. The Outsiders was an audacious debut written when S.E. Hinton was only seventeen, laying bare the hopes and terrors between teenage bravado in a world of drive-ins, drag races and switchblades. It confronted America with a new breed of anti-hero from the wrong side of the class divide, and became a bestselling classic of youthful rebellion. Susan Eloise Hinton (b. 1950) wrote her first book, The Outsiders, in 1967, when she was seventeen years old. Hinton is also the author of That Was When, This Is Now (1971), adapted into a film starring Emilio Estevez and Morgan Freeman; Rumble Fish (1975), also adapted into a film by Francis Ford Coppola, starring Mickey Rourke, Nicholas Cage and Dennis Hopper; Tex (1979); Taming the Star Runner (1988), and many others. Hinton lives in Oklahoma. If you enjoyed The Outsiders, you might like Jack Kerouac&#39;s On the Road, also available in Penguin Modern Classics. &#39;Gritty, emotional and very authentic&#39; Jodi Picoult &#39;The Outsiders is a teenage epic&#39; Francis Ford Coppola</p><p>According to Ponyboy, there are two kinds of people in the world: greasers and socs. A soc (short for &#34;social&#34;) has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back. Ponyboy is a greaser, and he&#39;s always been proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny kills a soc. The murder gets under Ponyboy&#39;s skin, causing his bifurcated world to crumble and teaching him that pain feels the same whether a soc or a greaser. This classic, written by S. E. Hinton when she was 16 years old, is as profound today as it was when it was first published in 1967.Ponyboy is fourteen, tough and confused, yet sensitive behind his bold front. Since his parents&#39; death, his loyalties have been to his brothers and his gang, the rough, swinging, long-haired boys from the wrong side of the tracks. When his best friend, Johnny, kills a member of a rival gang, a nightmare of violence begins and swiftly envelops Ponyboy in a turbulent chain of events.</p><h2>The Moving Body</h2><p>First published in 2002.

Rod Serling, an award-winning writer of television dramas, was the creator and host--and wrote more than 90 of the 156 episodes. The series has since been shown around the world and the title is now a part of pop culture lore. Serling adapted 19 of his favorite teleplays into short stories, first published as a trio of paperback originals. <i>The Twilight Zone: Complete Stories</i> is a hardcover omnibus collection that includes all 19 stories and a historical introduction. These stories have passed the test of time and are uniformly entertaining and well crafted. However, any reader who is a fan of the TV show may have difficulty allowing the stories to stand on their own without the filmed episodes intruding. Even so, Serling was undeniably a true master of the fantastic, and fans should cherish this volume beside their videocassettes of the series. <i>--Stanley Wiater</i></p><h2>Healing with Herbs and Rituals: A Mexican Tradition</h2><p><p><i>Healing with Herbs and Rituals</i> is an herbal remedy-based understanding of curanderismo and the practice of yerberas, or herbalists, as found in the American Southwest and northern Mexico.</p><p>Part One, "Folk Healers and Folk Healing," focuses on individual healers and their procedures.

A.A. cofounder Dr. Bob stated in his last major talk in Detroit, Michigan, in December 1948 that the basic ideas of A.A.'s 12 Steps came from Bill W. and Dr. Bob's study of the Bible [<i>The Co-Founders of Alcoholics Anonymous: Biographical Sketches: Their Last Major Talks</i> (Item # P-53), 14]. So too that the Book of James, Jesus's "Sermon on the Mount" (Matthew 5-7), and 1 Corinthians 13 were absolutely essential to the early program. Dr. Bob also said that he and Bill W. were convinced that the answer to their problems was in the Good Book (as he called the Bible) [<i>The Co-Founders of Alcoholics Anonymous</i>&nbsp;(Item # P-53), 13]. <i>The Good Book and the Big Book: A.A.'s Roots in the Bible </i>by Dick B.&nbsp;explores every observable source and appearance of Bible ideas in the Big Book which Bill W. began writing about three years after A.A. was founded in Akron in June 1935. It has become a regular shelf item among those who believe in God, understand the importance of the Bible, diligently seek to apply the teachings of Jesus Christ in the march to sobriety and a life of love of service thereafter. The book is a page-turner for those who, like the author at first, had never realized the specific sources of A.A. in the Bible, and the specific Bible language in A.A.'s basic text, talks, and literature of the early days.</p><p>"An astounding seventy-five to ninety-three percent of the early members of Alcoholics Anonymous recovered from their seemingly hopeless disease of alcoholism. They did it by relying on God and by basing their relationship with Him on the principles of the Bible. This comprehensive history discusses the biblical sources from which A.A.'s founders said they obtained their recovery ideas--focusing particularly on the Sermon on the Mount, 1 Corinthians 13, and the Book of James. For many AAs, the Bible was the standard of truth upon which they could depend for the power and guidance that they needed in their lives. Author Dick B.--an active, recovered member of A.A., a Bible student, and a sponsor of over seventy men in their recovery--here shows how a knowledge of A.A.'s Good Book roots can be used effectively to produce a high recovery rate in today's Twelve Step programs."<br><br>"The Bible and the 'Big Book' of Alcoholics Anonymous are not mutually exclusive, as the author, Dick B., carefully shows. The A.A. book which has helped millions with their addictions is deeply indebted to, and profoundly influenced by, biblical language, images, and themes gleaned directly from the Bible or indirectly from Bible teachers like Rev. Samuel Shoemaker, E. Stanley Jones, and Oswald Chambers. A.A. has received much from biblical Christianity, and biblical Christians can receive much from Dick's new book about spiritual growth and victorious living." (Rev. Charles B. Puskus, Jr., Ph.D., Author, An Introduction to the New Testament)<br><br>"Dick's exhaustive research gives us a clear picture of how Dr. Bob, Anne, Bill W., and the early AAs used the Good Book to help thousands recover." (Ray G., Archivist, Dr. Bob's Home, Akron, Ohio)<br><br>"We use Dick's book in all our counselor training centers. It is an invaluable resource." (Jean LaCour, Ph.D., Dean, The N.E.T. Training Institute, Florida)<br><br>"We're excited to have this book for scholars of A.A. that explains A.A.'s roots in the Bible!" (Ozzie and Bonnie L., Managers, The Wilson House, East Dorset, Vermont)<br><br>"Anyone seeking to learn the spiritual roots of Alcoholics Anonymous will find Dick B.'s publication, The Good Book and the Big Book, an invaluable resource. Dick has done a monumental job of finding and documenting the prime sources of A.A.'s life-renewing power." (John F. Seiberling, former United States Congressman, and son of Henrietta Seiberling, an early A.A. "founder.")Author Dick B. (1925-2015) was a writer; an &#34;unofficial&#34; historian of A.A.; a retired attorney; a Bible student; and active, recovered AA who has sponsored more than 100 men in their recovery. He devoted more than 25 years of his life to researching, reporting, and disseminating early A.A. history and successes. He had published 46 titles and more than 1,750 articles on A.A. history. Clergy, scholars, historians, and old-timers in A.A. have often called Dick B. the leading A.A. historian today.</p><h2>The Survival Medicine Handbook: A Guide for When Help is Not on the Way</h2><p>The 2nd edition Survival Medicine Handbook(tm) is a guide for those who want to be medically prepared for any disaster where help is NOT on the way.

Caroline Levine argues that forms organize not only works of art but also political life&#x2015;and our attempts to know both art and politics. Inescapable and frequently troubling, forms shape every aspect of our experience. Yet, forms don't impose their order in any simple way. Multiple shapes, patterns, and arrangements, overlapping and colliding, generate complex and unpredictable social landscapes that challenge and unsettle conventional analytic models in literary and cultural studies.</p><p>Borrowing the concept of "affordances" from design theory, this book investigates the specific ways that four major forms&#x2015;wholes, rhythms, hierarchies, and networks&#x2015;have structured culture, politics, and scholarly knowledge across periods, and it proposes exciting new ways of linking formalism to historicism and literature to politics. Levine rereads both formalist and antiformalist theorists, including Cleanth Brooks, Michel Foucault, Jacques Ranci�re, Mary Poovey, and Judith Butler, and she offers engaging accounts of a wide range of objects, from medieval convents and modern theme parks to Sophocles's <i>Antigone</i> and the television series <i>The Wire</i>.</p><p>The result is a radically new way of thinking about form for the next generation and essential reading for scholars and students across the humanities who must wrestle with the problem of form and context.</p></p><p><p>"This is a big, brilliant, necessary book. As demonstrated in its climactic discussion of <i>The Wire</i>, it takes the defense of formalism way beyond the insistence that the continuity of forms across time is as historical as their differences are. With a confidence backed by superb erudition, a lively eye for structures of injustice, and a refreshingly practical commitment to questions of how lives might be rearranged to make them more endurable, Caroline Levine is uniquely qualified to issue this trumpet blast of a manifesto."<b>--Bruce Robbins, Columbia University</b></p><p>"This is a truly extraordinary book, a book of a generation. If this were only a work of theory, it would already be one of the best scholarly books I've read. But it is also, more importantly, a model of method. Caroline Levine doesn't only prompt us to think; she shows us what to do. She has drawn the map that will lead us out of the dead end facing literary studies today--the dead end of wanting to talk about the literary in relation to the social but not knowing how."<b>--Amanda Claybaugh, Harvard University</b></p><p>"This is a superlative work of literary theory--lucid, elegant, sophisticated. Caroline Levine clearly explains why formalist analysis is the heart of what literary scholarship does best, and she defends form as a category that provides the most rigorous route to the connections between art and social context. This is a brilliant advance on the New Formalism."<b>--Nicholas Dames, Columbia University</b></p><b>Caroline Levine</b> is David and Kathleen Ryan Professor of the Humanities at Cornell University.

Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy, in which the hobbit Frodo and his elfish friends get swept up in a mighty conflict with the dark lord Sauron (who owes much to proud Satan in <i>Paradise Lost</i>), the monstrous Gollum, the Cracks of Doom, and the awful power of the magical Ring. The book's characters--good and evil--are recognizably human, and the realism is deepened by the magnificent detail of the vast parallel world Tolkien devised, inspired partly by his influential Anglo-Saxon scholarship and his Christian beliefs. (He disapproved of the relative sparseness of detail in the comparable allegorical fantasy his friend C.S. Lewis dreamed up in the Chronicles of Narnia, though he knew Lewis had spun a page-turning yarn.) It has been estimated that one-tenth of all paperbacks sold can trace their ancestry to J.R.R. Tolkien. But even if we had never gotten Robert Jordan's <i>The Path of Daggers</i> and the whole fantasy genre Tolkien inadvertently created by bringing the hobbits so richly to life, Tolkien's epic about the Ring would have left our world enhanced by enchantment. <i>--Tim Appelo</i>Includes the 50th anniversary fully corrected text setting and an extensive new index"An extraordinary work -- pure excitement." -- <i>New York Times Book Review</i>One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them <br>In ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and Sauron, the Dark Lord, forged the One Ring, filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others.

Using a &#x201c;knowledge building&#x201d; format where one concept is mastered before the next is introduced, <i>Civil Drafting Technology</i> includes:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li> Basic Drafting Topics </li> <ul> <li> Maps: fundamentals, types of maps, scales, symbols </li> <li> CADD: use, standards, applications </li> </ul> <li> Intermediate/Advanced Topics </li> <ul> <li> Measuring distance and elevation, Surveying, Location &amp; Direction, Legal Descriptions and Plot Plans, Contour Lines, Horizontal Alignment Layout, GIS </li> </ul> <li> Career Development </li> <ul> <li> Schooling, Employment, Workplace Ethics, Professional Organizations </li> </ul> <li> CADD Applications </li> <li> Content-related Tests </li> <li> Real-world drafting and design problems </li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>This book features expanded coverage of survey types, surveying methods, and instruments.Preface <p> This text is indented to be a comprehensive instructional package in the area of civil drafting. The authors have used materials that have been tested in the classroom for several years plus input and ideas from industry, specifically civil engineering companies. Our aim is to provide the student or employee with a well-rounded view of the civil drafting field and the types of drawings and skills associated with that field. </p><p> The book is arranged in eleven chapters, each dealing with a specific subject area. We feel that this arrangement lends itself well to a one-term or semester course but contains enough information and problems to fit courses of varying length. Each chapter is followed by a test composed of short essay, fill-ins, true/false, and sketching questions. Problems in the form of drawings, which close each chapter, can be completed in the text, on separate sheets of paper, or using computer-aided drafting (CAD) as instructed. The tests and problems enable the student to directly apply the information presented in each chapter to realistic situations. </p><p> The field of civil drafting is one filled with variety and excitement. From surveying to construction, courthouse research to artistic interpretation, the opportunities offer many challenges. The authors have drawn on their experiences of surveying in the jungles of Georgia to building houses in the foothills of the Oregon Cascades; from designing wastewater piping to designing solar homes. And most importantly, we have drawn on our collective experiences in teaching the varied aspects of drafting at the community college level. Additionally, we have included the work of contributing professionals in the applications of CAD throughout the entire text and the coverage of geographic information systems (GIS) as applied to civil drafting technology. Many educators, who have successfully used the first, second and third editions of this text have provided comprehensive reviews. These reviews resulted in expanded coverage in every chapter, plus new and varied drafting problem assignments. </p><p> The use of this text in the prescribed manner imparts to the student a broad understanding of the civil drafting and a working knowledge of the basic components of mapping. With this knowledge and skill, a variety of job opportunities are open to the student, and with those opportunities, we sincerely hope, a challenging career. Keep in mind that mapping requires accuracy, neatness, and an eye for creative and uncluttered layout. </p><p> The purpose of this book is to provide you with theories, concepts, and skills that form the foundation of work done by civil engineering companies. Most mapping in these companies is generated by specialized CAD software using a variety of data collecting by electronic surveying techniques. Regardless of the software used to construct maps, the drafter must still have the knowledge of why and how certain maps and drawings are created. For example, using raw field data from a survey crew, CAD software can automatically generate a map of contour lines showing the elevations and shape of the land, But then it is often the CAD drafter's job to interpret, adjust, and revise these maps and even describe and explain contour features to clients and contractors. </p><p> A CD, included in the back of this book, contains AutoCAD border and title block template drawings, as well as base drawings for many of the drawing problems in the book. In addition, it contains a chapter-by-chapter list of Internet web site links related to that chapter. Word files for al chapter tests and map reading exercises are also included. Suggested Course of Study </p><p> By studying this book and enrolling in a course in which you can apply the concepts presented here, you are providing yourself with an excellent civil drafting foundation. If you are interested in expanding your knowledge and skills in civil drawing and design, you should enroll in advanced civil courses, or courses that provide training in specialized civil engineering software. A wide variety of civil engineering design, modeling, and drafting software is in use today. Specific programs such as Autodesk's Land Development Desktop and Eagle Point Software's LANDCADD are widely used by engineering firms. You should enroll in specialized courses such as these after you have acquired the fundamental knowledge and skills that are presented in this book. We hope that your experiences with civil drafting and mapping are just as exciting as ours. Good Luck.</p></p><h2>Surf Craft: Design and the Culture of Board Riding (The MIT Press)</h2><p><p><b>The evolution of the surfboard, from traditional Hawaiian folk designs to masterpieces of mathematical engineering to mass-produced fiberglass. </b></p><p>Surfboards were once made of wood and shaped by hand, objects of both cultural and recreational significance. Today most surfboards are mass-produced with fiberglass and a stew of petrochemicals, moving (or floating) billboards for athletes and their brands, emphasizing the commercial rather than the cultural. <i>Surf Craft</i> maps this evolution, examining surfboard design and craft with 150 color images and an insightful text. From the ancient Hawaiian <i>alaia</i>, the traditional board of the common people, to the unadorned boards designed with mathematical precision (but built by hand) by Bob Simmons, to the store-bought longboards popularized by the 1959 surf-exploitation movie <i>Gidget</i>, board design reflects both aesthetics and history. The decline of traditional <i>alaia</i> board riding is not only an example of a lost art but also a metaphor for the disintegration of traditional culture after the Republic of Hawaii was overthrown and annexed in the 1890s.</p><p>In his text, Richard Kenvin looks at the craft and design of surfboards from a historical and cultural perspective. He views board design as an exemplary model of <i>mingei</i>, or art of the people, and the craft philosophy of Soetsu Yanagi. Yanagi believed that a design's true beauty and purpose are revealed when it is put to its intended use. In its purest form, the craft of board building, along with the act of surfing itself, exemplifies mingei. <i>Surf Craft</i> pays particular attention to Bob Simmons's boards, which are striking examples of this kind of functional design, mirroring the work of postwar modern California designers.</p><p><i>Surf Craft </i>is published in conjunction with an exhibition at San Diego's Mingei International Museum.</p></p><p>Richard Kenvin is Director of the Hydrodynamica Project.

How do they do it?</b></p><p>In this compelling book, strategy guru Roger L. Martin and Skoll Foundation President and CEO Sally R. Osberg describe how social entrepreneurs target systems that exist in a stable but unjust equilibrium and transform them into entirely new, superior, and sustainable equilibria. All of these leaders--call them disrupters, visionaries, or changemakers--develop, build, and scale their solutions in ways that bring about the truly revolutionary change that makes the world a fairer and better place.</p><p>The book begins with a probing and useful theory of social entrepreneurship, moving through history to illuminate what it is, how it works, and the nature of its role in modern society. The authors then set out a framework for understanding how successful social entrepreneuars actually go about producing transformative change. There are four key stages: understanding the world; envisioning a new future; building a model for change; and scaling the solution. With both depth and nuance, Martin and Osberg offer rich examples and personal stories and share lessons and tools invaluable to anyone who aspires to drive positive change, whatever the context.</p><p><i>Getting Beyond Better</i> sets forth a bold new framework, demonstrating how and why meaningful change actually happens in the world and providing concrete lessons and a practical model for businesses, policymakers, civil society organizations, and individuals who seek to transform our world for good.</p></p><p><p><b>Roger L.

The reality, though, is that we--the everyday people whose data powers AI--aren't actually in control of anything. When, for example, we speak with Alexa, we contribute that data to a system we can't see and have no input into--one largely free from regulation or oversight. The big nine corporations--Amazon, Google, Facebook, Tencent, Baidu, Alibaba, Microsoft, IBM and Apple--are the new gods of AI and are short-changing our futures to reap immediate financial gain. <br><br>In this book, Amy Webb reveals the pervasive, invisible ways in which the foundations of AI--the people working on the system, their motivations, the technology itself--is broken. Within our lifetimes, AI will, by design, begin to behave unpredictably, thinking and acting in ways which defy human logic. The big nine corporations may be inadvertently building and enabling vast arrays of intelligent systems that don't share our motivations, desires, or hopes for the future of humanity.<br><br>Much more than a passionate, human-centered call-to-arms, this book delivers a strategy for changing course, and provides a path for liberating us from algorithmic decision-makers and powerful corporations.</p><p><b>Amy Webb</b> is a quantitative futurist whose research focus is on artificial intelligence and how emerging technologies will transform the way we live, work, and govern. She is the author of <i>The Signals Are Talking: Why Today's Fringe Is Tomorrow's Mainstream</i>, a professor of strategic foresight at the NYU Stern School of Business, and the founder of the Future Today Institute, a leading future forecasting firm that helps leaders and their organizations prepare for complex futures. Now in its second decade, FTI advises Fortune 500 and Global 1000 companies, government agencies, large nonprofits, universities and startups around the world. Amy also publishes the annual FTI Emerging Tech Trends Report, which has now garnered more than 6.2 million cumulative views worldwide.<br><br>"Rather than questioning the character of thinking machines, futurist Amy Webb turns a critical eye on the humans behind the computers. With AI's development overwhelmingly driven by nine tech powerhouses, she asks: Is it possible for the technology to serve the best interests of everyone?"&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Wired</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Webb's assessments are based on analyses of patent filings, policy briefings, interviews and other sources. She paints vivid pictures of how AI could benefit the average person, via precision medicine or smarter dating apps...Her forecasts are provocative and unsettlingly plausible."&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>Science News</b></i></i></b><br><br>"Instead of predicting the future, Webb lays out scenarios for optimistic, pragmatic, and catastrophic outcomes -- all extrapolated from current facts. However impractical you may find the idea of a common Apple-Amazon operating system named Applezon, considering potential scenarios is a fantastically healthy exercise, because anyone who tells you they know how AI is going to turn out is lying."&#x2015;<b><i><b>VentureBeat</b></i></b><br><br>"We need to get Amy Webb to campus. This is one of those cases where organizing discussions of the book would be great - but not enough. We would be wise to engage with Webb directly... We need more books like The Big Nine that are critical of higher education for reasons beyond politics (liberal bias) or costs... The Big Nine is an essential book for anyone interested in a global perspective around the role of companies and governmental policies in determining technological change."&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>InsideHigherEd</b></i></i></b><br><br>"Webb is a first-rate storyteller...she has poured a lifetime of researching, writing, and conversing--in a word, thinking--into her masterwork."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Law.com</b></i></b><br><br><i>"The Big Nine</i> is provocative, readable, and relatable. Amy Webb demonstrates her extensive knowledge of the science driving AI and the geopolitical tensions that could result between the US and China in particular. She offers deep insights into how AI could reshape our economies and the current world order, and she details a plan to help humanity chart a better course."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Anja Manuel, Stanford University, cofounder and partner RiceHadleyGates</b></i></b><br><br><i>"The Big Nine </i>is an important and intellectually crisp work that illuminates the promise and peril of AI. Will AI serve its three current American masters in Washington, Silicon Valley and Wall Street or will it serve the interests of the broader public? Will it concentrate or disperse economic and geopolitical power? We can thank Amy Webb for helping us understand the questions and how to arrive at answers that will better serve humanity than our current path. <i>The Big Nine </i>should be discussed in classrooms and boardrooms around the world."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Alec Ross, author of <i>The Industries of the Future</i></b></i></b><br><br>"<i>The Big Nine </i>makes bold predictions regarding the future of AI. But unlike many other prognosticators, Webb sets sensationalism aside in favor of careful arguments, deep historical context, and a frightening degree of plausibility."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Jonathan Zittrain, George Bemis Professor of International Law and professor of Computer Science, Harvard University</b></i></b><br><br>"<i>The Big Nine</i> is thoughtful and provocative, taking the long view and most of all raising the right issues around AI and providing a road map for an optimistic future with AI."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Peter Schwartz, senior vice president, Salesforce.com, and author of <i>The Art of the Long View</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Webb's potential scenarios for specific futures are superb, providing detailed visions for society to avoid as well as achieve."&#x2015;<b><i><b>John C.

Never in his life had he seen a river before--this sleek, sinuous, full-bodied animal, chasing and chuckling, gripping things with a gurgle and leaving them with a laugh, to fling itself on fresh playmates that shook themselves free, and were caught and held again." Such is the cautious, agreeable Mole's first introduction to the river and the Life Adventurous. Emerging from his home at Mole End one spring, his whole world changes when he hooks up with the good-natured, boat-loving Water Rat, the boastful Toad of Toad Hall, the society- hating Badger who lives in the frightening Wild Wood, and countless other mostly well-meaning creatures.

The cosmos, once understood as a stagnant place, filled with the ordinary, is now a universe that is expanding at an accelerating pace, propelled by dark energy and structured by dark matter. Priyamvada Natarajan, our guide to these ideas, is someone at the forefront of the research&#x2014;an astrophysicist who literally creates maps of invisible matter in the universe. She not only explains for a wide audience the science behind these essential ideas but also provides an understanding of how radical scientific theories gain acceptance.<br><br> The formation and growth of black holes, dark matter halos, the accelerating expansion of the universe, the echo of the big bang, the discovery of exoplanets, and the possibility of other universes&#x2014;these are some of the puzzling cosmological topics of the early twenty-first century. Natarajan discusses why the acceptance of new ideas about the universe and our place in it has never been linear and always contested even within the scientific community. And she affirms that, shifting and incomplete as science always must be, it offers the best path we have toward making sense of our wondrous, mysterious universe.</p><p><b>How do you map the universe?</b> <br> Explorers once understood Earth by mapping what they saw. If I only included visible objects in my map of the universe, it would show a mere four percent of the cosmos. Equipped with Einstein&#x2019;s theory of general relativity, I use gravity to see how invisible &#x201c;dark matter&#x201d; bends light from stars and galaxies. This provides a remarkably detailed picture of the structure of the universe. <br> &nbsp; <br> <br> <b>Is dark matter real?</b> <br> Scientists know a lot about how dark matter is distributed in the universe and the critical role it plays in the formation of galaxies. Dark matter is mysterious because it lacks much personality&#x2014;it interacts very weakly with ordinary matter (like you), it moves sluggishly, and it accumulates in lumps. You are right to be skeptical&#x2014;the history of science is replete with abandoned invisible explanations (ether, miasma, and phlogiston)&#x2014;but there is much evidence that dark matter is real. <br> &nbsp; <br> <br> <b>Could a figure like Einstein exist today?</b> <br> No and yes. Many fields are so specialized that it is hard to imagine one person making an Einsteinian impact. That said, the Internet makes it much easier for an outsider to garner the attention of the scientific establishment. Of course she would still need transformative, innovative, and radical ideas. <br> &nbsp; <br> <br> <b>Where will we find the next radical scientific ideas?</b> <br> We now have copious data in cosmology, neuroscience, genetics, and material science. Finding and comprehending meaningful patterns in that data will allow us to mine for fundamental principles and new frontiers for exploration. This is how I think we are going to find the next radical idea that could upend everything! &nbsp;<b>Priyamvada Natarajan</b> is professor of astronomy and physics at Yale University and holds the Sophie and Tycho Brahe Professorship at the Dark Center, Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen, and an honorary professorship at the University of Delhi, India.</p><h2>The Counseling Practicum and Internship Manual, Second Edition: A Resource for Graduate Counseling Students</h2><p><p><b>Praise for the First Edition:</b></p> <p><i>"I highly recommend</i> The Counseling Practicum and Internship Manual. <i>It is the single best all-in-one resource I've read for all things practicum and internship."</i></p> <p><b>Ryan Thomas Neace,</b> LPC, NCC, CCMHC, Blogger, American Counseling Association; Founder, CounselingInternships.com and Change, Inc.</p> <p>This best-selling guide to the practicum and internship experience, written expressly for graduate counseling students by a seasoned counselor and educator, is now substantially revised with updated and expanded content including the <i>2014 ACA Code of Ethics</i>.

Using innovative linguistic techniques, along with methods from palaeobiology and other fields, it shows that spinning and pattern weaving began far earlier than has been supposed.</p><br><br><p> <i>Prehistoric Textiles</i> made an unsurpassed leap in the social and cultural understanding of textiles in humankind's early history. Cloth making was an industry that consumed more time and effort, and was more culturally significant to prehistoric cultures, than anyone assumed before the book's publication. The textile industry is in fact older than pottery--and perhaps even older than agriculture and stockbreeding. It probably consumed far more hours of labor per year, in temperate climates, than did pottery and food production put together. And this work was done primarily by women. Up until the Industrial Revolution, and into this century in many peasant societies, women spent every available moment spinning, weaving, and sewing.</p><br><p> The author, Elizabeth Wayland Barber, demonstrates command of an almost unbelievably disparate array of disciplines--from historical linguistics to archaeology and paleobiology, from art history to the practical art of weaving. Her passionate interest in the subject matter leaps out on every page. Barber, a professor of linguistics and archaeology, developed expert sewing and weaving skills as a small girl under her mother's tutelage. One could say she had been born and raised to write this book.</p><br><p> Because modern textiles are almost entirely made by machines, we have difficulty appreciating how time-consuming and important the premodern textile industry was. This book opens our eyes to this crucial area of prehistoric human culture.</p></p><p><b>E.J.W. Barber</b> is Professor of Linguistics and Archaeology at Occidental College and is a handweaver. <i>Prehistoric Textiles</i> won the Millia Davenport Publication Award of the Costume Society of America."This monumental study embraces linguistic and archaeological investigations, practical knowledge of weaving, palaeobiology, and other arcane sciences to trace the development of cloth."

He toured with the Wailers in the 1970s and was closely acquainted with Bunny Wailer, Peter Tosh and the rest of the band members. Over several decades he has interviewed more than seventy-five friends, business managers, relatives and confidants&#x2015;many speaking publicly for the first time. Forty years in the making, <em>So Much Things to Say</em> weaves this rich testimony into a definitive telling of the life of the reggae king&#x2015;the full, inside account of how a boy from the slums of Kingston, Jamaica, became a cultural icon and inspiration to millions around the world.</p><p>The intimacy of the voices and the frankness of their revelations will astonish even longtime Marley fans. Readers see the intense bonds of teenage friendship among Peter, Bunny and Bob, the vibrant early sessions with the original Wailers (as witnessed by members Junior Braithwaite, Beverley Kelso and Cherry Green) and the tumultuous relationships with Rita Marley and Cindy Breakspeare.</p><p>With unprecedented candor, these interviews tell dramatic, little-known stories, from the writing of some of Marley&#x2019;s most beloved songs to the Wailers&#x2019; violent confrontation involving producer Lee &#x201c;Scratch&#x201d; Perry, Bob&#x2019;s intensive musical training with star singer Johnny Nash and the harrowing assassination attempt at 56 Hope Road in Kingston, which led to Marley&#x2019;s defiant performance two nights later with a bullet lodged in his arm.</p><p>Readers witness Marley&#x2019;s rise to international fame in London, his triumphant visit to Zimbabwe to sing for freedom fighters inspired by his anthems and the devastating moment of his collapse while jogging in New York&#x2019;s Central Park. Steffens masterfully conducts the story of Marley&#x2019;s last months, as Marley poignantly sings &#x201c;Another One Bites the Dust&#x201d; during the sound check before his final concert in Pittsburgh, followed by his tragic death at the age of thirty-six.</p><p><em>So Much Things to Say</em> explores major controversies, examining who actually ordered the shooting attack on Hope Road, scrutinizing claims of CIA involvement and investigating why Marley&#x2019;s fatal cancer wasn&#x2019;t diagnosed sooner. Featuring Steffens&#x2019;s own candid photographs of Marley and his circle, this magisterial work preserves an invaluable, transformative slice of music history: the life of the legendary performer who brought reggae to the international stage.</p> 40 photographs</p><p><strong>Roger Steffens</strong> is the world&#x2019;s leading reggae historian, and former co-host of the award-winning radio program <em>Reggae Beat</em>. His programs on Marley&#x2019;s life have been presented at the Smithsonian and the Library of Congress, among other venues. He lives in Los Angeles, California.&#x201c;<em>So Much Things to Say</em> is a fascinating page-turner which leaves conclusions to the reader.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Gleaner</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This sprawling but gripping biography is a fitting tribute to Jamaica&#x2019;s favourite son.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Guardian</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;There has never been and will never be anything quite like this: Reggae's chief eyewitness, dropping testimony on Reggae's chief prophet with truth, blood, and fire.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Marlon James, Man Booker Prize-winning author of <em>A Brief History of Seven Killings</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>[So Much Things to Say]</em> narrates the life of Marley from cradle to grave...

It ranks with Mezz Mezzrow's <em>Really the Blues</em> masterpiece, Mike Gerber's <em>Jazz Jews</em> and Keith Richards' <em>Life</em>. It's beyond a book about music, it's a major ethnology study. Just like the best Mandela or Gandhi or Lennon biographies, it's about mankind on an anthropologic level. It's about identity, culture, pride, spirituality &#x2015; it helps us understand who we really are. That's what Bob Marley was all about, and as such his brilliant works stand unparalleled in the music business.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Bruno Blum, musician, music historian, writer, artist and lecturer based in Paris</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Eyewitness to history, Roger Steffens braids his voice with all the other major players from the Bob Marley story in <em>So Much Things to Say</em> for a gripping, detailed, and penetrating look at one of the 20th century's greatest musicians. Jah lives.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Joel Selvin, journalist and author of Altamont: The Rolling Stones, The Hells Angels, and the Inside Story of Rock&#x2019;s Darkest Day</strong><br><br>&#x201c;All true gospels are shaped by the accounts of eyewitnesses.

Few people living in 1860 would have dared imagine either event, and yet, in retrospect, both seem to have been inevitable.</p><p>In a beautifully crafted narrative, Edward L. Ayers restores the drama of the unexpected to the history of the Civil War. He does this by setting up at ground level in the Great Valley counties of Augusta, Virginia, and Franklin, Pennsylvania, communities that shared a prosperous landscape but were divided by the Mason-Dixon Line. From the same vantage point occupied by his unforgettable characters, Ayers captures the strategic savvy of Lee and his local lieutenants, and the clear vision of equal rights animating black troops from Pennsylvania. We see the war itself become a scourge to the Valley, its pitched battles punctuating a cycle of vicious attack and reprisal in which armies burned whole towns for retribution. In the weeks and months after emancipation, from the streets of Staunton, Virginia, we see black and white residents testing the limits of freedom as political leaders negotiate the terms of readmission to the Union.</p><p>Ayers deftly shows throughout how the dynamics of political opposition drove these momentous events, transforming once unimaginable outcomes into fact.

The humanist of our age.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;E. M. Forster</b><br><br><b>A Penguin Classic</b><br><br>In <i>The Immoralist</i>, Andr� Gide presents the confessional account of a man seeking the truth of his own nature. The story&#x2019;s protagonist, Michel, knows nothing about love when he marries the gentle Marceline out of duty to his father. On the couple&#x2019;s honeymoon to Tunisia, Michel becomes very ill, and during his recovery he meets a young Arab boy whose radiant health and beauty captivate him. An awakening for him both sexually and morally, Michel discovers a new freedom in seeking to live according to his own desires. But, as he also discovers, freedom can be a burden. A frank defense of homosexuality and a challenge to prevailing ethical concepts, <i>The Immoralist</i> is a literary landmark, marked by Gide&#x2019;s masterful, pure, simple style.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,800&nbsp;titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the&nbsp;series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date&nbsp;translations by award-winning translators.</p><p>With today's headlines and talk shows, it takes a lot to shock a reader--certainly more than was required in 1902, when Andr� Gide's <i>The Immoralist</i> was first published. What was seen then as a story of dereliction translates today into a tale of introspection and fierce self-discovery. While traveling to Tunis with his new bride, the Parisian scholar Michel is overcome by tuberculosis. As he slowly convalesces, he revels in the physical pleasures of living and resolves to forgo his studies of the past in order to experience the present--to let "the layers of acquired knowledge peel away from the mind like a cosmetic and reveal, in patches, the naked flesh beneath, the authentic being hidden there."<p> But this is not the Michel his colleagues knew, nor the man Marceline married, and he must hide his new values under the patina of what he now reviles. Bored by Parisian society, he moves to a family farm in Normandy. He is happy there, especially in the company of young Charles, but he must soon return to the city and academe. Michel remains restless until he gives his first lecture and runs into M�nalque, who has long outraged society, and recognizes in him a reflection of his torment. Finally, Michel heads south, deeper into the desert, until, as he confides to his friends, he is lost in the sea of sand, under a clear, directionless sky.</p><p> What Gide's story lacks in sensationalism is fulfilled by his descriptive prose, which evokes the exotic nature of Michel's inner and outer journey: "I did not understand the forbearance of this African earth, submerged for days at a time and now awakening from winter, drunk with water, bursting with new juices; it laughed in this springtime frenzy whose echo, whose image I perceived within myself." --<i>Joannie Kervran Stangeland</i></p><b>Andr� Paul Guillaume Gide</b>&nbsp;(1869&#x2013;1951) was born in Paris. His father, who died when he was eleven, was Professor of Law at the Sorbonne. An only child, Gide had an irregular and lonely upbringing and was educated in a Protestant secondary school in Paris and privately. He became devoted to literature and music, and began his literary career as an essayist, and then went on to poetry, biography, fiction, drama, criticism, reminiscence, and translation. By 1917 he had emerged as a prophet to French youth and his unorthodox views were a source of endless debate and attack. In 1947 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature and in 1948, as a distinguished foreigner, was given an honorary degree at Oxford. He married his cousin in 1895; he died in Paris at the age of eighty-one.<br><br> Among Gide's best-known works in England are <i>Strait is the Gate</i> (<i>La Porte �troite</i>), the first novel he wrote, which was published in France in 1909; <i>La Symphonie Pastorale</i>, 1919; <i>The Immoralist</i> (<i>L'Immoraliste</i>), 1902; <i>The Counterfeiters</i> (<i>Les Faux-Monnayeurs</i>), published in 1926; and the famous <i>Journals</i> covering his life from 1889 to 1949 and published originally in four volumes.</p><h2>Air Fryer Revolution: 100 Crispy, Healthy, Fast &amp; Fresh Recipes</h2><p>Best-selling author Urvashi Pitre is back with&nbsp;<i>Air Fryer Revolution</i>, the&nbsp;follow-up to her hit cookbook, <i>Every Day Easy Air Fryer</i>.

In this comprehensive and authoritative account, Ronald Calinger connects the story of Euler's eventful life to the astonishing achievements that place him in the company of Archimedes, Newton, and Gauss. Drawing chiefly on Euler&#x2019;s massive published works and correspondence, which fill more than eighty volumes so far, this biography sets Euler&#x2019;s work in its multilayered context&#x2015;personal, intellectual, institutional, political, cultural, religious, and social. It is a story of nearly incessant accomplishment, from Euler&#x2019;s fundamental contributions to almost every area of pure and applied mathematics&#x2015;especially calculus, number theory, notation, optics, and celestial, rational, and fluid mechanics&#x2015;to his advancements in shipbuilding, telescopes, ballistics, cartography, chronology, and music theory.</p><p>The narrative takes the reader from Euler&#x2019;s childhood and education in Basel through his first period in St. Petersburg, 1727&#x2013;41, where he gained a European reputation by solving the Basel problem and systematically developing analytical mechanics. Invited to Berlin by Frederick II, Euler published his famous <i>Introductio in analysin infinitorum</i>, devised continuum mechanics, and proposed a pulse theory of light. Returning to St. Petersburg in 1766, he created the analytical calculus of variations, developed the most precise lunar theory of the time that supported Newton&#x2019;s dynamics, and published the best-selling <i>Letters to a German Princess</i>&#x2015;all despite eye problems that ended in near-total blindness. In telling the remarkable story of Euler and how his achievements brought pan-European distinction to the Petersburg and Berlin academies of sciences, the book also demonstrates with new depth and detail the central role of mathematics in the Enlightenment.</p></p><p><p>"This is the first real biography of Leonhard Euler, and I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that it is the most important book about Euler to appear in any western European language in the past century. The scholarship is absolutely first rate and is based largely on original sources, a monumental feat. Many of the details are new, but so is the grand synthesis that puts them together in one narrative. I learned something new from almost every page."<b>--Dominic Klyve, Central Washington University</b></p><p>"Comprehensive and thorough, this study of the life, work, and times of Leonhard Euler is written in an accessible style and strikes the right balance between his technical accomplishments and historical context. This will be a standard, foundational work on which all future scholarship on Euler, eighteenth-century mathematics and science, and indeed Enlightenment intellectual life will rest."<b>--Kathryn M. Olesko, Georgetown University</b></p><p>"This will be the authoritative work on Euler's life. Embodying a great deal of research and information, the book provides a complete biography, connecting the year-by-year circumstances of Euler's life with his scientific work. One of the book's strengths is its account of the personal, institutional, and political milieu that formed the context of Euler's career."<b>--Craig Fraser, University of Toronto</b></p><b>Ronald S.

In Death, Mourning, and Burial, an indispensable introduction to the anthropology of death, readers will find a rich selection of some of the finest ethnographic work on this fascinating topic. This collectionoffers cross-cultural readings that span the period from dying to afterlife, approach this transition as a social process, and demonstrate the great variation of cultural responses to death.Death, Mourning, and Burial is divided into six parts that mirror the social trajectory of death: conceptualizations of death; death and dying; uncommon death; grief and mourning; mortuary rituals; and remembrance and regeneration. Each part includes one or two foundational texts on the anthropology of death---on topics such as the disruption of social ties and their restoration through ritual---as well as recent and exciting studies that demonstrate the intellectual breadth of the anthropology of death, such as those on organ donation, &#34;disappearances,&#34; and cannibalism.Not only will Death, Mourning, and Burial serve as a sourcebook and primary text for anthropology classes, it will provide a fine-grained book designed to bring a genuinely cross-cultural perspective to all those studying death and dying..<b>Antonius C.
